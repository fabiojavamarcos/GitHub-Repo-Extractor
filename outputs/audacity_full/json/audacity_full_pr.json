The sizes that are provided in the audacity icon are 256x256, 128x128, 96x96, 64x64, 48x48, 32x32, 24x24, 16x16, 14x14, 10x10, and 8x8.

I made audacity_InnoWizardImage.bmp using [the wiki logo](https://www.audacityteam.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NEW_AudacityTransMediaWiki_sans_serif.png), and the other one using a resized version of the icon.\n\nI have not attempted to handle the mac icon, as I don't know how to edit those (I don't even know which files are needed for the mac installer).", "NaN"], ["246", "Simplification in av_log_wx_callback, because wxLogDebug is threadsafe.", "Rapha\u00ebl Marinier", "RaphaelMarinier", "01/24/18, 06:22:26 PM", "wxLogDebug is threadsafe since wxWidgets 2.9.1 (releated in 2010)\naccording to\nhttp://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/overview_log.html#overview_log_mt.\n\nNote also that wxLogDebug could already have been called from multiple\nthreads even with EXPERIMENTAL_OD_FFMPEG unset.

We do want to keep the last autosave\nconsistent with the in-memory state.)\n\n# Pull Requests\n\nIf you are submitting a pull request, please read https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/GitHub_Pull_Requests ", "NaN"], ["610", "Fix the reading of autosave files...", "Paul Licameli", "Paul-Licameli", "07/11/20, 05:49:37 AM", "... problem was in recreating strings from buffers, but copying too many because\nnull terminators were lacking.\n\n# Pull Requests\n\nIf you are submitting a pull request, please read https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/GitHub_Pull_Requests ", "NaN"], ["613", "Char width info goes in the unique data dictionary only once per run", "Paul Licameli", "Paul-Licameli", "07/11/20, 06:10:58 PM", "# Pull Requests\n\nIf you are submitting a pull request, please read https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/GitHub_Pull_Requests ", "NaN"], ["615", "fix asio build on windows", null, "micsthepick", "07/17/20, 06:52:25 AM", "ASIO was not getting included in the Windows build, even though the appropriate environment variable was defined, This PR will fix the check for if ASIOSDK_DIR is defined in  cmake-proxies/portaudio-v19/CMakeLists.txt, according to https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/ENV.html", "NaN"], ["616", "Canonicalize integers in binary blob format, BREAKING COMPATIBILITY...", "Paul Licameli", "Paul-Licameli", "07/18/20, 04:59:27 AM", "... with .aup3 projects saved earlier in 3.0.0 development, except for 32 bit\nWindows builds.\n\nUse fixed-width integer types when writing the binary format blobs, not\nbool, short, int, size_t, ..., which might vary among machines and so make\n.aup3 files non-portable.\n\nChoose the widths to write whatever is narrowest among the four builds; this\nmakes a difference only for long and size_t which are 32 bits in the 32 bit\nWindows build.

The reason is that they use very outdated build scripts, which do not work on AppleSillicon machines even when cross-compiling.\n\n---\n\nWe use Docker to construct a clean Ubuntu 20.04 environment with the required packages to verify that we can build using system libraries only.

PortAudio is updated to 19.7.0\n2. System PortAudio can be used. Besides Linux packaging, this is important to fix #1360\n\nTo update PortAudio, the following steps were taken:\n\n* #946 was merged into this branch. This is required because `PaUtil_GetTime` is private, which is arguably the upstream error anyway.\n* `libnyquist` and `portmixer` build systems were updated:\n  * Corresponding  `CMakeLists.txt` moved into the lib-src.\n  * New PortAudio target is linked to the libraries.\n  * `portmixer` build system detects PortAudio capabilities.\n  * Libraries were moved out of the dependencies CMakeLists.txt\n  \n  It is unlikely the `libnyquist` and `portmixer` will be devendored because they are very Audacity specific, so it makes sense not to treat them as 3d party dependencies, at least for not.\n* `portmixer` now compiles with unmodified PortAudio. However, the full functionality on Windows requires patches to PortAudio:\n  * A [patch](https://github.com/audacity/conan-recipes/blob/main/portaudio/all/patches/19.7.0/pawinmme-export.patch) to export PaWinMME_ functions, which are public, but not usable if PortAudio is built as DLL. \n  * A [patch](https://github.com/audacity/conan-recipes/blob/main/portaudio/all/patches/19.7.0/winds-getguid.patch) that allows getting the DirectSound device GUID. Without it, there was no reliable way to retrieve the GUID.\n \nAdditionally, there are the following patches applied to the Conan provided library:\n\n* A [patch](https://github.com/audacity/conan-recipes/blob/main/portaudio/all/patches/19.7.0/enable-oss.patch) to enable OSS support. \n* A [patch](https://github.com/audacity/conan-recipes/blob/main/portaudio/all/patches/19.7.0/wasapi-loopback.patch) to enable WASAPI loopback devices.\n\nOne patch to PortAudio was dropped because it seemingly fixed the bug in Audacity rather than PortAudio. Also it broke `IsStreamStopped() == !IsStreamActive()` for WASAPI.\n\nLinux [packaging scripts](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/tree/master/linux/packages) were updated, so packages are built against the system PortAudio, the results were verified on corresponding systems.\n\nThe `PortAudio devendored` commit is large because it is impossible to break it into smaller commits that compile and run, as bringing the unmodified PortAudio library as an external dependency breaks lots of stuff around.\n\nThis PR was tested with all available Host APIs on Windows and with ALSA and Jack2 on Linux. OSS, while it was verified that it is enabled - failed to me for all Linux distros I was testing against.\n\n<!-- Use \"x\" to fill the checkboxes below like [x] -->\n\n- [x] I signed [CLA](https://www.audacityteam.org/cla/)\n- [x] I made sure the code compiles on my machine\n- [x] I made sure there are no unnecessary changes in the code\n- [x] I made sure the title of the PR reflects the core meaning of the issue you are solving\n- [x] I made sure the commit message(s) contain a description and answer the question \"Why do those changes fix that particular issue?\" or \"Why are those changes really necessary as improvements?\"", "NaN"], ["1437", "Fix update on UIHandle change within cell", "Vitaly Sverchinsky", "vsverchinsky", "08/09/21, 12:02:31 PM", "Resolves: #1363 \n\n<!-- Use \"x\" to fill the checkboxes below like [x] -->\n\n- [x] I signed [CLA](https://www.audacityteam.org/cla/)\n- [x] I made sure the code compiles on my machine\n- [x] I made sure there are no unnecessary changes in the code\n- [x] I made sure the title of the PR reflects the core meaning of the issue you are solving\n- [x] I made sure the commit message(s) contain a description and answer the question \"Why do those changes fix that particular issue?\" or \"Why are those changes really necessary as improvements?\"", "NaN"], ["1441", "Fix event types used in PrefsListener singalling...", "Paul Licameli", "Paul-Licameli", "08/09/21, 09:05:44 AM", "... which broke at a2f109d\n\nResolves: #1421 \nResolves: #1369\n\nEvents were failing to be processed because event types were set incorrectly.\n\n- [x] I signed [CLA](https://www.audacityteam.org/cla/)\n- [x] I made sure the code compiles on my machine\n- [x] I made sure there are no unnecessary changes in the code\n- [x] I made sure the title of the PR reflects the core meaning of the issue you are solving\n- [x] I made sure the commit message(s) contain a description and answer the question \"Why do those changes fix that particular issue?\" or \"Why are those changes really necessary as improvements?\"", "NaN"], ["1442", "Track panel fixes", "Paul Licameli", "Paul-Licameli", "08/12/21, 02:42:13 PM", "Resolves: #1339\nResolves: #1368\n(and addresses part of #1375)\n\nAlternative proposal to fix the problems of minimization of tracks with affordances, and the fit-to-height (Ctrl+Shfit+F) command.

This leads to a problem, where updating FFmpeg can be problematic. This is especially true, as a new major version is soon to be released.\n\nThe main problem with FFmpeg is that it exposes several structures and expects library users to fill them up during the configuration. These structures can change between major version bumps, while the API is mostly stable. This is unlike other C libraries, where structure fields are accessed using the library-provided functions.\n\nThis PR:\n\n* Allows generating a single header file for a specific FFmpeg version. Surprisingly it had required a large subset of C preprocessors to be implemented.\n* Provides wrappers around used FFmpeg structures. The wrappers are used as RAII objects where applicable. The wrappers are implemented in `inl` files which are later included in C++ files after the correct FFmpeg header. I.e. currently each wrapper is compiled twice. Wrappers rarely have FFmpeg version-dependent code. \n* Fixes few incompatibilities between FFmpeg versions.\n* Sample format conversions from FFmpeg are templatazied, all formats are now supported. The reverse process was not modified\n\nI have tried to keep changes in ImportFFmpeg and ExportFFmpeg small and trivial. In the future, we may want to reimplement them as well.\n\nCurrently, avformat-55 and avformat-58 are supported. I don't see much reason to support 56 and 57. When 59 will be released (and current dev branches are 59) it will be added to the list, this should be a trivial task.\n\nBuilds were tested against:\n\n* 2.2.2, 4.3.1, and 4.4. Surprisingly, 4.4 support was different (and the most difficult!) from 4.3.1 while the major version stayed the same. FFmpeg 4.4 was downloaded from the \"official page\".\n* The system library on Manjaro (4.2.2)\n\n<!-- Use \"x\" to fill the checkboxes below like [x] -->\n\n- [x] I signed [CLA](https://www.audacityteam.org/cla/)\n- [x] The title of the pull request describes an issue it addresses\n- [ ] If changes are extensive, then there is a sequence of easily reviewable commits\n- [x] Each commit's message describes its purpose and effects\n- [x] There are no behavior changes unnecessary for the stated purpose of the PR\n\nRecommended:\n- [ ] Each commit compiles and runs on my machine without known undesirable changes of behavior", "NaN"], ["1630", "Not move clip on insertion by default", "Vitaly Sverchinsky", "vsverchinsky", "09/08/21, 10:54:28 PM", "Changing \"Editing a clip can move other clips\" option default value to false\n\nResolves: #1333\n\nChanging \"Editing a clip can move other clips\" option default value to false\n\n<!-- Use \"x\" to fill the checkboxes below like [x] -->\n\n- [x] I signed [CLA](https://www.audacityteam.org/cla/)\n- [x] The title of the pull request describes an issue it addresses\n- [x] If changes are extensive, then there is a sequence of easily reviewable commits\n- [x] Each commit's message describes its purpose and effects\n- [x] There are no behavior changes unnecessary for the stated purpose of the PR\n\nRecommended:\n- [x] Each commit compiles and runs on my machine without known undesirable changes of behavior", "NaN"], ["1636", "Fix VST time info samplePos units", null, "Niko-Sound", "09/08/21, 10:59:40 AM", "Resolves: *(https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1628)*\n\n*VST time info samplePos should be a value in number of samples, not in seconds*\n\n<!-- Use \"x\" to fill the checkboxes below like [x] -->\n\n- [x] I signed [CLA](https://www.audacityteam.org/cla/)\n- [x] The title of the pull request describes an issue it addresses\n- [x] If changes are extensive, then there is a sequence of easily reviewable commits\n- [x] Each commit's message describes its purpose and effects\n- [x] There are no behavior changes unnecessary for the stated purpose of the PR\n\nRecommended:\n- [x] Each commit compiles and runs on my machine without known undesirable changes of behavior", "NaN"], ["1637", "Disentangle midi play from audio io", "Paul Licameli", "Paul-Licameli", "09/23/21, 03:09:38 AM", "Resolves: #1581\n\nNext refactoring steps for AudioIO.\n\nAll of the logic specific to MIDI playback is removed from AudioIO.cpp, and invoked instead through an abstract base class AudioIOExt.
