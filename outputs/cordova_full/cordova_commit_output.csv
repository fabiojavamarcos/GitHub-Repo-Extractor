+# The tweets/ folder
+
+To create a new tweet create a new `*.tweet` file in this `tweets/` folder.
+
+<kbd>[Create new tweet](../../../new/master/?filename=tweets/<your-path>.tweet)</kbd>
+
+## Example
+
+Create a new file `tweets/hello-world.tweet` with the content
+
+> Hello, world!
+
+You can use subfolders, e.g. `tweets/2019-02/hello-world.tweet`, as long as the file is in the `tweets/` folder and has the `.tweet` file extension
+
+## Create a tweet with a twitter poll
+
+**Note**: The configured twitter account needs to be authorized to use Twitters Ads API in order to send tweets including a poll.
+
+A tweet including a poll must end with 2-4 options in the following format
+
+> Here is some text
+>
+> ( ) option A  
+> ( ) option B  
+> ( ) option C  
+> ( ) option D
+
+## Notes
+
+- Only newly created files are handled, deletions, updates or renames are ignored.
+- `*.tweet` files will not be created for tweets you send out directly from twitter.com
+- If you need to rename an existing tweet file, please do so locally using [`git mv old_filename new_filename`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/renaming-a-file-using-the-command-line), otherwise it may occur as deleted and added which would trigger a new tweet.
+
+## Questions?
+
+If you have any further questions or suggestions, please create an issue at https://github.com/gr2m/twitter-together/issues/new, ","This pull requests creates the `tweets/` folder where your `*.tweet` files go into. It also creates the `tweets/README.md` file with instructions.

Note that if you plan to support tweets with polls, your twitter app has to be approved for Twitters Ads API. See [The Ads API Application Form](https://github.com/gr2m/twitter-together/blob/master/docs/03-apply-for-access-to-the-twitter-ads-api.md) documentation for more details.
