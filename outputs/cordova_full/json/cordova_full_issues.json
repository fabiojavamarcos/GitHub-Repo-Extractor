But now it seems the scope is expanding. \r\n\r\nI am hoping we are not increasing the scope and delaying Cordova 9 release for items that may not be important, or can be release in a minor.\r\n\r\nCan we list out what are the remaining items and why?\r\n\r\n- Android P had already been officially released since August 6, 2018.\r\n- iOS 12 and Xcode 10 is already officially released.\r\n \r\nI want to prevent scope creeping if necessary. =||= My list of remaining items looks something like this:\r\n\r\n* **Bridge WebView plugin for UIWebView/WKWebView**\r\n* **Update Xcode Project to be compatible with Xcode 10**\r\n  (WIP at https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/pull/409, but this needs more testing)\r\n* **iOS Cocoapod improvements**\r\n  (WIP at https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues/391, ready to merge?)\r\n* **Updating Android gradle files to not use deprecated commands**\r\n  (PR at https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/486, waiting for someone who understands gradle to review)\r\n* **Updating Android gradle version to latest to deal with incompatibilities with newest NDK tools**\r\n  (See https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/issues/504, again need someone who understands gradle) =||= @dpogue \r\n\r\n**The CocoaPods improvement** is done and can be merged in now. \r\n1. Merge `cordova-common` PR\r\n2. Release `cordova-common` next major tagged `3.0.0`.\r\n3. Update `cordova-ios` package.json with `cordova-common@^3.0.0`\r\n4. Merge `cordova-ios` CocoaPods PR\r\n\r\nIs the **Android Gradle's latest version** actually a requirement for this next major? Without the latest version, does Android P builds fails? This task seems new and unexpectedly added.\r\n\r\nI already reviewed **Updating Android gradle files to not use deprecated commands** and said that the changes were OK. The question I left as a comment only asked if we should allow developers the flexibility to pick between `implementation` and `api`. Adding the support is not required for next major. \r\n\r\nI knew there were **other Gradle PRs** that had questions about adding the helper methods into the dependencies scope to better isolate features that not everyone uses for example Kotlin and EnableGoogleServicesPlugin.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/438\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/441 =||= I think the issue with the Android Gradle latest version is that the current projects are not compatible with the latest Android Studio.\r\n\r\nI believe newer versions of gradle are now warning that `compile` support will be dropped at the end of 2018, and the work to update to `implementation` is already done, so I think we should get this in the next major. With regards to `implementation` vs `api`, I think at the app level `implementation` makes sense. =||= I stand to what I have said on the mailing list: \r\n\r\n> I think we just have to start the process. We have to do the releases in order anyway and there is the [buy-in phase][1] for each release, so any blockers will surface when it's the turn of the respective repo. The first release that would have to be done is `cordova-common`.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I have no capacities to do any release management myself right now.\r\n\r\nThings that should be resolved before the respective major release:\r\n\r\n- For platforms: https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/32\r\n- https://github.com/apache/cordova-fetch/pull/44 (basically finished; would appreciate another review)\r\n- https://github.com/apache/cordova-fetch/issues/47 (would like some opinions before we release the new major)\r\n- Do the deprecation-part of https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/issues/689\r\n\r\nRegarding committing `package-lock.json`: Since there was little feedback after the latest concerns I would still assume consensus for the original plan. However, we might as well postpone this task to any following release, since the presence of `package-lock.json` [affects development only](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c06d35b6944fb44a04449a7baf10797f8ae11cbcfddb3e90851dc0b9@%3Cdev.cordova.apache.org%3E) anyway.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/tools-release-process.md#get-buy-in =||= @raphinesse I will try to take a look at those tickets tomorrow that you linked for review and opinions.\r\n \r\n- For https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/32, I also seen this. I looked into it before and it should be a one liner to delete.\r\n\r\n- As for the `package-lock.json`, IMO I would commit it. I don't really experience the negative affects that everyone else seems experience so much. I have actually seen more positive cases. For example: the recent CI tests failure because one of the dependency updated and it had an issue. Locally, it passed because I had the lock. Anyways its just my opinion. =||= @erisu Yes, #32 should be straightfwd. Just needs to be done, and I'm already distracting myself too much :sweat_smile:.\r\n\r\nRe package-lock: I don't care either way for the coming release. Downside is, it's another thing to be done.\r\n\r\nI forgot about https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/50 in my previous post. Would be nice to have this in the coming release. I think it's good to go as is, but its verification has been stalled by our uncovering of various Windows issues. Since `cordova-common` will be the first release to do, our schedule might be too tight to squeeze in this change. =||= I can start #32 tomorrow as well and put in the PRs for review etc. So you don't distract too much :) =||= `cordova-common@3.0.0` has been published, which checks off step 1 from the list. =||= I just raised <https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/pull/721> with a proposal for cordova-lib to export the Cordova `common` object, so that Cordova CLI should not need `cordova-common` in its dependencies. This proposal should reduce the chance of violating the [cordova-common singleton rule](https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/tools-release-process.md#cordova-common-singleton-rule). I hope we can get this kind of enhancement into Cordova 9. =||= I think it would be ideal if we can squeeze in a couple more updates to `cordova-common` before Stage 2, in order to use real singletons instead of following the [cordova-common singleton rule](https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/tools-release-process.md#cordova-common-singleton-rule):\r\n* Refactor CordovaLogger to a singleton class - approved PR in <https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/53>\r\n* Refactor CordovaEvents to a singleton class as discussed in <https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/53#issuecomment-443561178> =||= @brodybits Since `cordova-common@3`, for Cordova 9, had already been released, I don't think we need to focus on this.

This behavior is also mentioned in several places in https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/versioning-and-release-strategy.md.\r\n\r\nThe clear disadvantage of this behavior is that we need to do a release of `cordova-lib` (and `cordova-cli` that contains it) to update the pinned versions. Until then, people just running e.g. `cordova platform add android` will get an outdated version by default and (from experience on Stack Overflow, Ionic Forum and `support` issues here) have to be told regularly to update the platform when they encounter a bug (`cordova platform add android@7.1.1`) - it is just not really expected behavior for most users that the default command doesn't install the newest version.\r\n\r\n1. Why do we need pinned versions?\r\n1. What is the history behind this feature?\r\n1. What are the advantages of it?\r\n1. Does this behavior still make sense today?\r\n1. Can we maybe get rid of it and replace it with \"will install `latest` by default, but can of course still be overridden by supplying a specific version\" in a future cli/lib version?", "I guess the idea is that when you install an old version of Cordova, you get platform versions that are compatible with it, instead of the incompatible, latest version. =||= That might be have been a motivation.  \r\nIs there no other mechanism to select a platform that actually works with the CLI version (or other way around: For a platform to require a Cordova CLI / cordova-lib version)?\r\nEven then, is this worth the added hassle? Aren't there better mechanisms to achieve this? Especially as a removal would only affect future cli/lib releases? =||= In general, I'm not opposed to the mindset that you get a \"proven working\" combination of modules with whatever version of Cordova you're using and then updating those modules as desired.\r\n\r\nI imagine this is similar to downloading an installer for a desktop application, which then installs an update right after the initial installation.\r\n\r\nFrom your initial assessment, I would conclude that the actual issue is that the user will not realize that newer packages may be available. I would suggest leaving the version pinning in place and instead add update checks as applicable. Maybe along the lines of https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier\r\n\r\nIf that's not acceptable, I would prefer dropping version pinning and putting emphasis on the latest versions of the modules. The old versions of platforms and other modules are losing importance constantly, because technologies are deprecated and removed all the time. I don't even know what I could do today with a 2 year old Cordova version; pinned versions or not. So providing users with the best code possible (which should be the latest) should be preferred. =||= That's exactly where my thoughts come from: You would have to upgrade everything to make it work with modern iOS and Android. =||= > In https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/blob/master/src/platforms/platformsConfig.json\r\n> Cordova \"pins\"\r\n> [...]\r\n\r\nto a specific MAJOR+MINOR version using the `~` (tilde) character, which would still match if a patch is made on the same MAJOR+MINOR version.\r\n\r\nI *think* some of the `semver` rules and features would apply if used by the user, would have to investigate and test to say for sure.\r\n\r\n> 4\\. Does this behavior still make sense today?\r\n\r\nI think so.\r\n\r\nDefinitely should not use higher major version of a platform unless explicitly requested by user.\r\n\r\nIt *should* also be possible for Cordova to the platform to specific major only by using `^` (caret).

But the first `cordova platform add android` experience of a user would still be suboptimal unless we always keep the pinned versions up to date.

I have not used that particular module in my own code. I just picked it as an illustration of what I had in mind: A non-intrusive way to notify the user about new versions. =||= >>> I think some of the semver rules and features would apply if used by the user\r\n>>> [...]\r\n>>\r\n>> What \"user\" are you referring to here?\r\n>\r\n> Cordova CLI user\r\n\r\nThat might as well be, but is not relevant regarding the version pinning (meaning: default version installed when _no_ version is specified by the user, no exact version and no semver anything). Or did I misunderstand? =||= > The user just runs `cordova platform add android` and expects to get the latest and greatest.\r\n\r\nI think \"latest\" should have been written with back-ticks (`latest`) since `latest` tag on npm generally means latest stable release (my understanding, at least).\r\n\r\nIf the Cordova CLI user would do `cordova platform add android@latest`, for example, then the Cordova CLI does the following (just tested with `cordova@8.0.0` package version):\r\n* fetch `cordova-android@latest` from npm\r\n* add `<engine name=\"android\" spec=\"latest\" />` to `config.xml` (this will go away in next major Cordova release)\r\n* add `\"cordova-android\": \"^7.1.1\"` entry to `package.json`\r\n\r\nI am coming around to favor that this should be the case by default, if the Cordova CLI user runs `cordova platform add android` for example. But this means that we better ensure that newer major release of Cordova platform packages will work with older major release of Cordova CLI, to a reasonable extent at least. =||= I actually really meant \"latest and greatest\" above, not any deeper specific meaning.\r\nBut: \"latest and greatest\" probably is `latest` on npm, so you are correct \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\n> But this means that we better ensure that newer major release of Cordova platform packages will work with older major release of Cordova CLI, to a reasonable extent at least.\r\n\r\nThat of course is an absolute requirement, including the ability to config a platform release to only be installed in CLI versions it works with (meaning e.g. \">12.0.0\" or similar if that new platform only works with CLI 12 and newer because we changed something there).\r\n =||= @janpio What you describe in your last comment would usually be handled using `peerDependencies`. In this approach, a platform would specify that it needs one of a certain range of Cordova versions to be installed alongside it to work properly.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that we recommend users to install tooling globally while platforms are installed locally. Moreover, we seem to support more than one workflow where platforms are used without `cordova-lib` (platform-centric with `plugman`, using only platforms and their scripts, ...) =||= > What you describe in your last comment would usually be handled using peerDependencies. In this approach, a platform would specify that it needs one of a certain range of Cordova versions to be installed alongside it to work properly.\r\n\r\nDoes this already work? Does this make sure, a platform requiring a newer \"interface\" doesn't get installed with older CLIs?\r\n\r\n> The problem here is that we recommend users to install tooling globally while platforms are installed locally. Moreover, we seem to support more than one workflow where platforms are used without cordova-lib (platform-centric with plugman, using only platforms and their scripts, ...)\r\n\r\nOk, so does this answer the question I posed in my original post? Do we need the pinning because of that? =||= Sorry for not being clearer. When I wrote\r\n\r\n> would usually be handled using `peerDependencies`\r\n\r\nI meant that such a scenario would usually be handled using `peerDependencies` *in the npm eco-system*. The rest of my post describes why this is not easily achievable with how Cordova is currently laid out.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I think that the version pinning we do in `cordova-lib` is somewhat of a crutch to compensate for that. Whether we actually *need* it is quite subjective IMHO. =||= For the record: `cordova-lib@9` has relaxed the version pinning from `~` to `^` so as to allow minor updates of platforms to be propagated without publishing an update to the library. =||= "], ["19", "This is a test", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "09/20/18, 12:43:55 PM", "Testing https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/5\r\n\r\nYo!", "NaN"], ["20", "Update README.md", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "09/20/18, 12:22:08 PM", "NaN", "NaN"], ["21", "Update README.md", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "09/20/18, 12:24:48 PM", "NaN", "NaN"], ["22", "Another test", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "09/20/18, 12:55:37 PM", "NaN", "NaN"], ["23", "Testing", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "09/20/18, 02:16:41 PM", "Testing...", "NaN"], ["24", "Testing Automation", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "09/20/18, 02:47:40 PM", "...", "NaN"], ["25", "Cordova CLI telemetry report, Node", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "02/17/19, 02:51:51 PM", "The \"parsed\" node MAJOR versions are wrong for node v10, being reported as v1.

Can we remove them? Currently in question is `create`, but the rest can probably go as well.\r\n\r\nI believe project creations is typically performed with Cordova CLI. I am not sure how many people actually create a project from the platform package.\r\n\r\n# Purpose of the question\r\n## The originating problems background\r\nOnce bundled dependencies were removed, when a platform is added, all of the dependencies are installed into the projects root directory, flattened. Therefore the copy command fails because the `node_modules/cordova-ios/node_modules` directory no longer exists.\r\n\r\n## Removing the bug\r\nYes, the best solution is to remove the copy command but there are still test failures to resolve.\r\n\r\n## The test failures\r\nThe failures are coming from `create.spec.js`, an e2e test file. The test uses the `create` binary to create a project. When creating a project, a path must be provided where the project will be created. In that folder, since the platform is being copied over and not installed via NPM, it needs the `node_modules` of the checked out platform to copy over. If it's not copied, it will fail later due to missing packages.\r\n\r\nIf I attempt to copy the `node_modules` directory into the temp project folder before it is called, create process will fail because it will appear as if the project already exists.\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/erisu/cordova-ios/jobs/433949167#L3190\r\n\r\n## The question\r\nBasically, there were two options that I can think of. If CLI `cordova platform add ios` is the typical pattern, should the ability to create a project from the platform be valid? If not it can be removed.\r\n\r\nIf we want to maintain this option, we can update the binary to pass in a flag within the options argument. The flag could be called `isNotCli: true`, and then update the copy node_modules line to come from the `__dirname` and only called when `isNotCli: true`. The reason for a negated option is so we do not need to update CLI code. \r\n\r\nAlternative flags could be: `isPlatformBin: true`, ... \r\n\r\nI am thinking the binaries can be removed and the tests using the binaries as well can be removed.\r\n\r\nIf you have any confusion let me know and I will try to clear it up. =||= @erisu Usually I'm all in favor of reducing the surface of Cordova's public API. However, there are people that actually use platforms on their own (see one of the old open PRs in cordova-lib) and while I myself never have users it before, this actually seems like a good feature to me.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think it would be best to not remove any more stuff in next major.\r\n\r\nThat's all just a first impression. I really need to take a closer look to make an informed decision. I hope I'll be able to do that this weekend.\r\n\r\nAnd please note the updates to the issue description I recently made. =||= An interesting problem (that we can defer for the moment) is that our dist packages won't have bundled node_modules anymore, so they won't run out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\nOur release process is to generate tarballs and vote on them, and then publish those to npm, so we don't really want the node_modules folder to be in those packages at publish time, but we do want node_modules in the tarball that we make available for download from the website. =||= Is the tarball really a fully a supported distribution method (besides npm)? Does anybody use that? Why? =||= To work a project that consists of a single platform, using the `./bin/create` script from the tarball instead of cordova-cli. =||= OK. =||= From the description of this issue:\r\n\r\n> we actually _still_ need to either copy or preferably link `<PROJECT>/node_modules/cordova-<PLATFORM>/node_modules` to `<PROJECT>/platforms/<PLATFORM>/node_modules` _if the former exists_. Otherwise Node's module resolution would not pick up the correct dependency versions for the platform in case of version conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe recent PRs by @erisu seem to ignore this fact. This is mandatory to not break module resolution. Or did you consider this and I am mistaken here? IMO, we need something like this in the create scripts:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// ROOT is the platform module root\r\nconst platformDependencies = path.join(ROOT, 'node_modules');\r\n\r\nif (fs.existsSync(platformDependencies)) {\r\n  const localPlatformDependencies = path.join(project_path, 'cordova/node_modules');\r\n  fs.ensureSymlinkSync(platformDependencies, localPlatformDependencies, 'junction');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat should fix things until we find time to do it the right way (just my opinion):\r\n> In the long run, we should probably try to have only native projects in `platforms` and keep the platforms' build scripts in the project's `node_modules` and run them from there. That should make things easier and cleaner IMHO. =||= There are a bunch of similar-sounding problems here, and I think you've identified one and @erisu handled one, but they're not quite the same problem and it probably makes sense to try to identify all the problems:\r\n\r\n1. **Existing released platforms need their node_modules copied when installing with the CLI**\r\n  This *should* already happen, because the copy command is unconditionally in their project create scripts.\r\n\r\n2. **Existing released platforms need their node_modules copied when installing using `bin/create` from a tarball**\r\n  This is currently broken because the tarballs don't include node_modules, but I think it's out of our current scope to try to fix this for existing releases.\r\n\r\n3. **Current platforms do not need their node_modules copied because they should match the CLI**\r\n  But it's not safe to rely on this, which is what I believe @raphinesse is pointing out. See case 5 below.\r\n\r\n4. **Current platforms need their node_modules copied when installing using `bin/create` from a tarball**\r\n  @erisu fixed part of this by ensuring that the bin/create scripts will include the command to copy node_modules. One problem that still exists is that the tarball releases on dist don't actually include node_modules, but that's probably also out of scope for this particular discussion (it should, however, get raised for discussion in terms of our release process).\r\n\r\n5. **Current platforms with a future CLI (or vice versa) need their node_modules copied when installing with the CLI**\r\n  This is @raphinesse's point, that is the complication in case 3. If we install an older platform, its dependencies might not match the versions used by the CLI, so we would need to copy the nested node_modules folder to ensure we don't break module resolution.\r\n\r\nThe PRs from @erisu solve part of case 4, but we probably need to always copy node_modules if they exist to handle case 5.\r\n\r\nAre there any additional edge cases that I've missed?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDoing this \"the right way\", and running the platform API scripts from the node_modules folder itself is definitely something we should eventually try to move towards, but we would still need to account for case 4 that requires copying everything. =||= Currently installing a platform from a local folder (e.g. `cordova platform add \"C:\\Projects\\cordova5\\cordova-android\" --verbose`) is broken because of this subject:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/issues/362#issuecomment-443547612 =||= @raphinesse @dpogue Can this ticket be closed or are there still edge cases missing? =||= I don't really have a good grasp of the current state of things. But if all platforms behave like Android (if `node_modules` exists then copy it to platforms folder), I believe we are fine for the upcoming major release.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdding a platform straight from a tarball is probably still broken for any platforms without bundled dependencies. However, I believe we should not support that workflow anymore. But that should be discussed in another issue targeting a future major release. =||= @raphinesse If I am correct, you're referring to the standalone non-CLI usage workflow? \r\n\r\nIf I am correct, I believe we mentioned somewhere that an extra step to the current workflow is now required.\r\n\r\nFor users who use the tarball or GH repo for the standalone approach (non-CLI) must run `npm i  --only=prod` before running the `bin/create`. Then the create script would copy the `node_modules` folder into the platform folder as it has done in the past.\r\n\r\n> **Side note**: It is  highly recommended to use the NPM packaged tarball from the Apache Distribution. It is not recommended to use the GH repo directly or the package tarball from GH release page as these may contain the `package-lock.json` and additional non-essential files. The Apache Distribution contains the official release package and accurate for production usage. It will never contain the `package-lock.json` and should not contain non-essential files.\r\n* [Apache Cordova Platform Release Distribution](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/cordova/platforms/) =||= "], ["33", "[Plugins] Update Travis tests to use newer Node", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "01/30/19, 03:02:15 PM", "Currently: `node_js: '4.2'`", "This is a duplicate of #72 (or vice-versa) :) =||= Yours is better \ud83d\udc4d  =||= "], ["34", "add link to cordova-status page and hide deprecated repos", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "11/06/18, 06:54:32 PM", "NaN", "NaN"], ["35", "[Plugins] Android Tests are failing across multiple plugin repos", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "10/01/18, 11:36:18 AM", "Plugin tests for Android are failing without a real reason.\r\n\r\nExample: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media-capture/pull/106\r\n\r\nRelevant lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncordova-paramedic: checking requirements for platform android\r\nAndroid Studio project detected\r\nRequirements check results for android:\r\nJava JDK: installed 1.8.0\r\nAndroid SDK: installed true\r\nAndroid target: not installed \r\nPlease install Android target / API level: \"android-27\".\r\nHint: Open the SDK manager by running: /usr/local/android-sdk-25.2.3/tools/android\r\nYou will require:\r\n1. \"SDK Platform\" for API level android-27\r\n2. \"Android SDK Platform-tools (latest)\r\n3. \"Android SDK Build-tools\" (latest)\r\nGradle: installed /usr/local/gradle-4.0.1/bin/gradle\r\nSome of requirements check failed\r\n```", "Some more:\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/jobs/434727613\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/builds/289379855\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/builds/287227686\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-media/builds/311419853\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-media/builds/339152123\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-media/builds/311431203\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-media/builds/272094609\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-media/builds/327789730\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-media/builds/296268004\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-file/builds/255658784\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-file/builds/286810466\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-file/builds/272167732\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-file/builds/337820191\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/builds/334181780\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/builds/371966835\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/builds/404480535\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-camera/builds/429727607\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/builds/399113972\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/builds/400047387\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/builds/404406102\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/builds/364128083\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/builds/280594147\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/builds/434634121\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/builds/435044500 =||= failing `master` because of this:\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-battery-status/builds/365898871\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation/builds/396764011 =||= Solved by adding `,android-27` to the end of the \"accept Android SDK terms\" command in `.travis.yml`.

Are you installing the newest version of all plugins?\r\n\r\nTo solve this, I would suggest you create a new project with the newest CLI and cordova-android, then install the plugins manually with their newest versions. If everything works, you can just copy over your code.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can of course make sure to use the newest versions of everything to fix this. =||= "], ["46", "[Plugins] Android tests break when a new CLI is released that pins a new cordova-android version that requires a new Android target to be installed", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "05/10/19, 10:13:58 PM", "This is a rerun of a test, that passed 2 months before. So the exact same test, that used to pass, now does not any more: https://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts/jobs/431412788\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the plugin tests install the newest CLI with `npm install -g cordova`. If there is a new version of the CLI that pins a newer version of `cordova-android` that requires a newer Android target to be installed by default, this will fail as the Android targets to be installed are defined in `travis.yml`: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts/blob/99f9ea9ff94959c20a7823619744118725d09e31/.travis.yml#L60\r\n\r\nSo just by releasing a new CLI version with a new pinned `cordova-android`, we can make all the plugin tests for Android fail.\r\n\r", "Possible solution: \r\nInstall a specific version of the CLI instead of just `npm install -g cordova`: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts/blob/99f9ea9ff94959c20a7823619744118725d09e31/.travis.yml#L64 Disadvantage of that: All the `.travis.yml` files of the plugins have to be updated when a new CLI version is released.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas? =||= Nothing we can do about it - either we have to specify the Android version, or the CLI version in the config. =||= I think having cordova-cli as a devDependency would be an easy and clean solution. Or is it only used in CI, not in local tests? =||= Yeah, this is about the Android SDK/tools version being installed by CI that has to be compatible with the pinned cordova-android version of Cordova CLI. New CLI release is automatically installed by CI, but CI config still uses older Android SDK. =||= Yes, but by specifying a semver range for the CLI in devDependencies that forbids major updates, that could be solved cleanly =||= Sorry, I might be missing something here:\r\nWon't this limit what version of the CLI can be used with the plugin? \r\nThe problem is not the plugin itself, which is perfectly fine with all Android SDK tooling (it is not relevant), but that the plugin CI has configured a specific Android SDK that can break when a new Cordova CLI is released. =||= > Won't this limit what version of the CLI can be used with the plugin?\r\n\r\nNot, if you specify a version range as a devDependency or in the CI config as you previously suggested. After taking a quick look at the repo you linked, I'd say that installing a specific version in the CI config makes more sense in this case. =||= I still don't understand. Won't we have to make us update the config/package.json with each (major) CLI release vs. just sometimes when the pinned cordova-android requires a new Android SDK? =||= > Won't we have to make us update the config/package.json with each (major) CLI release vs. just sometimes when the pinned cordova-android requires a new Android SDK?\r\n\r\nThat is completely true. Sorry, I might have misunderstood you earlier.\r\n\r\nYes, we will have to decide whether we want to have scheduled maintenance at possibly shorter intervals or regular breakage at possibly longer intervals. I'd rather opt for the first alternative, but I see the appeal in the latter, given the amount of plugins.\r\n\r\nIMHO the underlying problem here is that we have too much overhead for simple house keeping tasks. In this case, a mono repo for plugins would probably make things easier. =||= Ok, at least my understanding of the situation was correct.\r\n\r\nMonorepo sounds nice in theory, in practice the even worse chaos in issues and PRs would offset these benefits by a lot.\r\n\r\nI think for now we'll keep it like it is. Future updated to the Travis config can easily be scripted as I unified them over all plugins, so this shouldn't be too much work next time. =||= "], ["52", "cordova-android version check failed ... continuing anyways", "Chris Brody", "brodybits", "03/27/19, 09:05:00 AM", "As reported by @purplecabbage in [[1]](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3ab1ed7ac85905b2cd4b85eb58e6ee72c01821c65308e42d5827050f@%3Cdev.cordova.apache.org%3E):\r\n\r\n```\r\nInstalling \"cordova-plugin-whitelist\" for android\r\n\r\ncordova-android version check failed\r\n(\"/Users/jessem/test/android713/platforms/android/cordova/version\"),\r\ncontinuing anyways.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom a quick code search I found the \"version check failed\" message in `cordova-lib`, at: [src/plugman/install.js#L182 ([2])](https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/blob/master/src/plugman/install.js#L182)\r\n\r\nIn response to a followup question @purplecabbage wrote:\r\n\r\n> The cli is linked current master\r\n\r\nLooking at the code it looks like this warning message is emitted when attempt to spawn a version check script fails with an error.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to reproduce this warning so far, hopeful that someone else can provide a better reproduction scenario.

A recent example is <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/7534>, which they landed in <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/commit/405e8d3710b518f36d026a619e16e59775d7b971>. (Earlier PouchDB PRs such as <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/2900> were actually closed rather than merged since the GitHub merge tool was less advanced back then. And Node.js still seems to close accepted PRs with \"landed\" messages instead of actually merging them; <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/23163> is an example.)\r\n\r\nI am starting to favor keeping the PR number at the end, like GitHub does by default, to make things easier.

Check the adobe forums and you'll see dozens of topics about the iOS 13 SDK requirements not met by Phonegap Build and no official answer. =||= As we discuss `cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter` does not work on PhoneGap build.\r\nIt means this solution is not perfect for me.\r\n\r\nThat's why I re-created another plugin, which is written in `gradle` script.\r\n[cordova-androidx-build](https://github.com/wf9a5m75/cordova-androidx-build)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this plugin is little different from `cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter`.\r\n`cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter` migrates the project code from `Android Support Libraries` to `AndroidX libraries`, which is one way.\r\nThis is OK for general developers. However plugin developers have to support both environments for a while (`cordova-android@8` and `cordova-android@9`).\r\n\r\nThat's why this plugin migrates from `AndroidX libraries` to `Android Support Libraries` if the environment does not support `AndroidX`.\r\n\r\n![work-flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167831/83340259-c2773400-a28a-11ea-8bb5-56d4a1a170fe.png)\r\n\r\nAnd this plugin uses `Gradle` script, works on PC and cloud services.\r\n\r\n\r\n|                                  | cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter | cordova-androidx-build    |\r\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| `support library` -> `AndroidX`  |  :white_check_mark:             | :white_check_mark:        |\r\n| `support library` <- `AndroidX`  |  :x:                            | :white_check_mark:        |\r\n| work on PC                       |  :white_check_mark:             | :white_check_mark:        |\r\n| work on cloud services           |  :x:                            | :white_check_mark:        |\r\n| when execute the process         |  after `cordova prepare`        | gradle sync               |\r\n| mechanism                        |  `cordova hook script`          | gradle                    |\r\n =||= @wf9a5m75 sadly, it is not working:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\r\n\r\n* What went wrong:\r\nExecution failed for task ':app:mergeReleaseResources'.\r\n> This project uses AndroidX dependencies, but the 'android.useAndroidX' property is not enabled.

Given the sheer volume of existing web JavaScript libraries and frameworks, I would favor a quick list of unique benefits, how it compares to some close alternatives, and how it compares to some well-known frameworks such as Angular/Vue/React. =||= @brodybits have you had time to check out the 47 pages of the wiki? I will try to compile a bullet point list. This was made especially for Webview with Cordova in mind, unlike Angular/React. Didn't think there was enough framework for Cordova... What a weird comment with all due respect. =||= - OGX.JS does not rely on any tech stack, it is highly portable and does not require any compiler\r\n- OGX.JS has templating operations unlike other frameworks, with temporary properties and global var support and loop operations\r\n- OGX.JS supports template-binding to object properties (render different objects within the same list)\r\n- OGX.JS has all the components already built-in so you don't need to code as much as other frameworks to output a pro grade app\r\n- OGX.JS data handling is NoSQL, inspired by MongoDB (via OGX.List or MongOGX) unlike SQL based solutions, including querying, sorting, filtering, and multi level grouping, writing, reading.\r\n- OGX.JS allows binding between components to filter/sort/display\r\n- OGX.JS can transform and render complex datasets via different components with one line, including data trees (transform simple array into data trees and render it with one line via different components)\r\n- OGX.JS is scope based and can render different data depending on the user scope\r\n- OGX.JS is mobile first and has a multitude of components supporting drag, swipe, swipe reveal, reorder, tap-hold-drag-drop\r\n- OGX.JS supports simple popups, tabbed popups, windows, views and tabbed views\r\n- OGX.JS supports multiple virtual apps within an app via a Threater or \"stage explorer\"\r\n- OGX.JS supports auto blur/focus on all components in/out of the screen\r\n- OGX.JS handles loading, storing and routing via a single app.json config, including preloading fonts, sounds, images, html templates..\r\n- OGX.JS is fully event based\r\n- OGX.JS supports fields and form binding including restrictions, validation and population\r\n- OGX.JS has built in geo operations to work with maps and geo data such as addresses\r\n- OGX.JS has built in color tools\r\n- OGX.JS is thoroughly tested on iOS, Android, including ChromeOS and works also perfectly for PWA's\r\n- And all of the other good stuff a framework is expected to have (history management, locking, dynamic views, display objects and much more).\r\n- You do not need any other tool/library to built complex apps unlike other frameworks that are \"programming frameworks\".

Or a MWE if it's more complex? That could increase the chance of someone confirming this. Sorry for having you wait. =||= Yeah, sorry I should have narrowed this down sooner.  Basically, I just started with a simple `cordova create`.\r\nHere is the package.json I am using:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"cordova\": \"^9.0.0\",\r\n    \"cordova-android\": \"^8.0.0\",\r\n    \"cordova-plugin-geolocation\": \"4.0.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"cordova\": {\r\n    \"plugins\": {\r\n      \"cordova-plugin-geolocation\": {}\r\n    },\r\n    \"platforms\": [\r\n      \"android\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is the config.xml:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\r\n<widget id=\"io.cordova.hellocordova\" version=\"1.0.0\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets\" xmlns:cdv=\"http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0\">\r\n    <name>HelloCordova</name>\r\n    <description>Hello</description>\r\n    <author email=\"dev@cordova.apache.org\" href=\"http://cordova.io\">hello</author>\r\n    <content src=\"index.html\" />\r\n    <access origin=\"*\" />\r\n    <allow-intent href=\"http://*/*\" />\r\n    <allow-intent href=\"https://*/*\" />\r\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-geolocation\" spec=\"4.0.1\" />\r\n    <platform name=\"android\">\r\n        <allow-intent href=\"market:*\" />\r\n        <!-- <config-file parent=\"/*\" target=\"AndroidManifest.xml\">\r\n            <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" />\r\n        </config-file> -->\r\n    </platform>\r\n    <engine name=\"android\" spec=\"^7.1.4\" />\r\n</widget>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you leave that line commented out and run an `npx cordova prepare`, you will see that the generated `platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` will have the proper location permissions:\r\n```\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\" />\r\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\" />\r\n<uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.location.gps\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you uncomment the lines in the config.xml, however, and re-run your `npx cordova prepare`, it will remove those permissions.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that I do see the following warning on prepare:\r\n```\r\nConflict found, edit-config changes from config.xml will overwrite plugin.xml changes\r\n```\r\nHowever, I have always seen that warning, so I thought nothing of it when upgrading to Cordova 9.  Using Cordova 8, I saw that warning, but it still had all of the permissions in the AndroidManifest file.  It may very well be that I should be requesting camera permission in a different way than what I am attempting to do here, because it is clearly not allowing both the way I am specifying and the way the plugin wants to use.  What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEben =||= Seems to me that sometimes, plugins specify permissions, but sometimes they don't.  I can specify them with a `<config-file>`, but doing so should not overwrite the permissions specified by plugins I have added, right? =||= > Seems to me that sometimes, plugins specify permissions, but sometimes they don't. I can specify them with a `<config-file>`, but doing so should not overwrite the permissions specified by plugins I have added, right?\r\n\r\nAgreed. I'll try to see if I can reproduce your issue. But from first glance, it does _not_ look like it's your fault. =||= This sounds exactly like https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/issues/389 and https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/issues/704 =||= @ekrapfl I can reproduce the issue. @dpogue Thanks for linking these issues. Would be great if @knight9999 could look into this. I actually have zero knowledge of the whole `ConfigChanges` code in `cordova-common`. =||= After upgrading to **Cordova 9.0.0 & Cordova-Android 8.0.0** I also reproducibly experienced a similar problem were the otherwise correctly generated Android Manifest file under **platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** was corrupted during **'cordova prepare'** phase. The actual changes (manifest \"corruption\") consisted in removing several **uses-permission** and **uses-features** tags from the initially correct manifest:\r\n```xml \r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" />\r\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.FLASHLIGHT\" />\r\n    <uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera\" android:required=\"true\" />\r\n```\r\nAfter digging a lot to find a solution to avoid this annoying behavior, I ended up with a final work-around where I used a Cordova hook for **before_prepare** & **after_prepare** that will backup & restore the correct manifest. \r\n\r\nUntil an official fix/update will be provided, here is the hook that I've implemented, hoping to be useful for others encountering this bug. \r\nPlease note the hook (to be removed when the bug is fixed!) is implemented into a single JavaScript file (**hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js**) covering both events being registered under **config.xml** as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<hook type=\"before_prepare\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/>\r\n<hook type=\"after_prepare\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBelow I included the relevant **hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js** JavaScript code that will backup & restore the manifest where the new created files (**AndroidManifest.xml.good** + **AndroidManifest.xml.bad**) are saved directly under **app** root folder (outside the **src** path) to avoid being included into Android app build processing.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n\r\n/* eslint-env node */\r\nvar fs = require(\"fs\"),\r\n\tutils = require(\"./utils\"),\r\n\tcolors = utils.colors,\r\n\tlog = utils.log;\r\n\r\n// hook function\r\nfunction hook(context) {\r\n\tvar manifestPath = \"./platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml\",\r\n\t\tmanifestPathGood = \"./platforms/android/app/AndroidManifest.xml.good\",\r\n\t\tread = function(file) {\r\n\t\t\treturn fs.readFileSync(file, \"utf8\");\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\twrite = function(file, str) {\r\n\t\t\treturn fs.writeFileSync(file, str, \"utf8\");\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tcopy = function(source, dest) {\r\n\t\t\twrite(dest, read(source));\r\n\t\t};\r\n\tif (context.hook === \"before_prepare\") {\r\n\t\t// backup the manifest\r\n\t\tlog(\"Backup 'AndroidManifest.xml' as \" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));\r\n\t\tcopy(manifestPath, manifestPathGood);\r\n\t} else if (context.hook === \"after_prepare\") {\r\n\t\tvar manifestText = read(manifestPath),\r\n\t\t\tmanifestTextGood = read(manifestPathGood),\r\n\t\t\tmanifestPathBad = \"./platforms/android/app/AndroidManifest.xml.bad\";\r\n\t\t// check if the the manifest was changed during preparation\r\n\t\tif (manifestText !== manifestTextGood) {\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"Save corrupted 'AndroidManifest.xml' under \" +\tcolors.yellow(manifestPathBad));\r\n\t\t\twrite(manifestPathBad, manifestText);\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"Restore 'AndroidManifest.xml' from \" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));\r\n\t\t\twrite(manifestPath, manifestTextGood);\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"The AndroidManifest.xml is not modified during prepare \" + colors.red(\" -> The 'android_manifest_fixer' hook is NOT needed anymore !\"));\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// export hook function\r\nmodule.exports = hook;\r\n```\r\n =||= Thanks for the workaround, @cyparu!

I'm glad you have found a workaround that works for you, though!\r\n\r\nDid you've properly registered the hook under config.xml ? Check this link ( https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/9.x/guide/appdev/hooks/#configxml )  for additional info on how to use the Cordova hooks.\r\n\r\nIf you are running `cordova prepare|build android --verbose` ( see: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/9.x/reference/cordova-cli/index.html#project-command-list ) you should see more info related to hook executions and if everything works fine you should also find the 2 generated files **(AndroidManifest.xml.good + AndroidManifest.xml.bad)** are saved directly under **platforms/android/app** folder =||= Yes, I added the hook, and it was running.  It was erroring out if I do not have an existing AndroidManifest.xml (ie: first time prepare).  It did not error out when I ran a `cordova platform add android` instead of the prepare (just trying to hit it from a different angle), but in that case, it gave me an AndroidManifest.xml that had even more stripped out of it.  I saw that it generated the `.good` and `.bad`, but neither of them was the one that I would have expected.  The `.bad` was the one that I have previously been getting from `cordova prepare` (makes sense), but the `.good` was an even more stripped down version.  It had less than what the previous one did. =||= > \r\n> \r\n> Yes, I added the hook, and it was running.

See the snippets below:\r\n\r\n**config.xml** updates:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<hook type=\"before_build\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/>\r\n<hook type=\"before_prepare\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/>\r\n<hook type=\"after_prepare\" src=\"hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js\"/> \r\n```\r\n**android_manifest_fixer.js** updates:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n\r\n/* eslint-env node */\r\nvar fs = require(\"fs\"),\r\n\tcolors = require(\"chalk\"),\r\n\tlog = console.log,\r\n\tinBuildPhase = false; \r\n\r\n// hook function\r\nfunction hook(context) {\r\n\tvar manifestPath = \"./platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml\",\r\n\t\tmanifestPathGood = \"./platforms/android/app/AndroidManifest.xml.good\",\r\n\t\tread = function(file) {\r\n\t\t\treturn fs.readFileSync(file, \"utf8\");\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\twrite = function(file, str) {\r\n\t\t\treturn fs.writeFileSync(file, str, \"utf8\");\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tcopy = function(source, dest) {\r\n\t\t\twrite(dest, read(source));\r\n\t\t};\r\n\tif (!inBuildPhase) { // enable the fixed just in build \r\n\t \tif  (context.hook === \"before_build\") {\r\n\t\t\t// flag the build phase\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"Enter build phase, enable the fixer!\");\r\n\t\t\tinBuildPhase = true\r\n\t \t}\r\n\t} else if (context.hook === \"before_prepare\") {\r\n\t\t// backup the manifest\r\n\t\tlog(\"Backup 'AndroidManifest.xml' as \" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));\r\n\t\tcopy(manifestPath, manifestPathGood);\r\n\t} else if (context.hook === \"after_prepare\") {\r\n\t\tvar manifestText = read(manifestPath),\r\n\t\t\tmanifestTextGood = read(manifestPathGood),\r\n\t\t\tmanifestPathBad = \"./platforms/android/app/AndroidManifest.xml.bad\";\r\n\t\t// check if the the manifest was changed during preparation\r\n\t\tif (manifestText !== manifestTextGood) {\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"Save corrupted 'AndroidManifest.xml' under \" +\tcolors.yellow(manifestPathBad));\r\n\t\t\twrite(manifestPathBad, manifestText);\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"Restore 'AndroidManifest.xml' from \" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));\r\n\t\t\twrite(manifestPath, manifestTextGood);\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tlog(\"The AndroidManifest.xml is not modified during prepare \" + colors.red(\" -> The 'android_manifest_fixer' hook is NOT needed anymore !\"));\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n// export hook function\r\nmodule.exports = hook;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the manifest corruption is happening just during pre-build prepare , I hope this enhanced handling will better isolate the problem and preserve the proper manifest.\r\n\r\n =||= Okay, so using your new script, if I start completely fresh (nuke node_modules, platforms, and plugins), do an `npm install`, and then run `cordova prepare`, then `cordova build android`, I end up with no difference from what I had before adding the hook.  Still missing some of the permissions.\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't necessarily need the workaround for now, I am just hoping for a fix.  Any news on that front @knight9999 or @raphinesse? =||= @raphinesse is there any update to share on this?  I know some other issues were mentioned as potentially related.  Unfortunately, this is still completely blocking us from using Cordova 9 and its amazingly fast prepare speeds :( =||= Unfortunately there is no progress on this that I know of. I understand that this is a serious problem. Incidentally, a personal friend just told me that he's affected by it too. As I stated above, unfortunately I myself am not acquainted with the code responsible for the config changes. Neither do I have time to dive into it right now.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the bug might be caused by https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/24. So if you should want to take action yourself, you could go ahead and try if reverting that change fixes the bug for you. =||= @raphinesse Is there anyone else who could be poked to look into it?  I know dpogue said he has no time for Cordova at the moment, and you are unfamiliar with the area.  I have reached out to the original author of the PR in question, and he has not responded.  I would love to be able to help on this, but I have looked over the code from that PR, and I am completely clueless on what I would do to fix it.  I apologize for being so persistent on this issue, but as you said, it is a serious problem, so I want to make sure I am exhausting all of my options to get it resolved.\r\n\r\nThanks again! =||= @erisu can you free up something for this? If the aforementioned PR is really the culprit, would it be feasible to revert it? Better to have broken uninstalls than installs IMHO.\r\n\r\n@ekrapfl can you verify that it works when using the latest version of cordova-common with the changes from the PR reverted? =||= I can give that a shot next week and let you know if it works for me. =||= @raphinesse Thanks you for responding the issue.\r\nAnd sorry. As all you mentioned, there are some problems.\r\n\r\nBasically, my PR https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/24 is aiming to correct counting\r\nin the munge section in platform.json.\r\n\r\nThis does not permit the conflicting of config-file/edit-config strictly.\r\nWhen conflicting happens between config.xml and plugin.xml, the config.xml has priority and used.\r\nEven if the conflicting is solvable.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the user must describe all permissions in config.xml if the user want to use additional permission which conflict to plugin.xml.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\n<config-file parent=\"/*\" target=\"AndroidManifest.xml\">\r\n            <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" />\r\n            <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\" />\r\n            <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\" /> \r\n            <uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.location.gps\" />\r\n</config-file>\r\n```\r\n \r\n =||= @raphinesse I can confirm that reverting that PR does fix the issue for me.\r\n@knight9999 I suppose a valid work around for the time being could be to take on the config-file additions from our plugins, but that doesn't seem like a permanent solution.  If plugins specify their own config dependencies, why should I have to duplicate what they have already said they need?\r\n\r\nThanks! =||= @ekrapfl  Thank a lot for the reporting your result.\r\nYes, I agree your opinion.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, the current situation in cordova config.xml/plugin.xml system is very complicated.\r\n\r\nBecause users can always edit their config.xml and add/remove plugins in any order.\r\nSome config.xml/plugin.xml may conflict each other.\r\nOne more difficulty is how to recover the setting files when the plugin is removed if it was merged in complicated way.\r\nThe other difficulty is how to distinguish which settings are already applied, which settings are not yet applied and then which settings are merged in what way when the users edit his config.xml.\r\n\r\nI think the `munge` system builtin cordova is a good system to resolve them, but it may be not enough.\r\n\r\nI image that the bi-directional system (add <-> remove,  edit <-> recover, merge <-> unmerge are possible) is too difficult.\r\nI think that the one-way system (it always generates settings files from the original files by applying each patch) is more simple even if there is still conflict problem.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n =||= > Okay, so using your new script, if I start completely fresh (nuke node_modules, platforms, and plugins), do an `npm install`, and then run `cordova prepare`, then `cordova build android`, I end up with no difference from what I had before adding the hook. Still missing some of the permissions.\r\n> \r\n> Again, I don't necessarily need the workaround for now, I am just hoping for a fix. Any news on that front @knight9999 or @raphinesse?\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that cordova@9 generates a wrong manifest even while removing/adding platform from scratch.\r\n\r\nI have managed to use the workaround suggested (btw, thank you very much @cyparu) by downgrading cordova to version 8, removing android platform, adding it again (AndroidManifest.xml is correct on this point), uninstalling cordova 8, installing cordova 9.\r\n\r\nBTW, facing this issue on several projects. Not only for third party plugins, but for own edit-config tags. I cannot use my own network_security_config, which used to work on cordova 8 (this edit-config is default on ionic):\r\n```\r\n<edit-config file=\"app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml\" mode=\"merge\" target=\"/manifest/application\" xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\r\n    <application android:networkSecurityConfig=\"@xml/network_security_config\" />\r\n</edit-config>\r\n<resource-file src=\"resources/android/xml/network_security_config.xml\" target=\"app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml\" />\r\n``` =||= @gartorware Thanks for the detailed report. Does your issue still exist?\r\n\r\nI have tried your `config.xml`\r\n```\r\n        <edit-config file=\"app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml\" mode=\"merge\" target=\"/manifest/application\" xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\r\n            <application android:networkSecurityConfig=\"@xml/network_security_config\" />\r\n        </edit-config>\r\n        <resource-file src=\"resources/android/xml/network_security_config.xml\" target=\"app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml\" />\r\n```\r\nwithout any plugin.\r\n\r\nIn Cordova 8.1 (cordova-android 7.1.4) project, the AndroidManifest.xml leads\r\n```\r\n    <application android:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\" android:icon=\"@mipmap/icon\" android:label=\"@string/app_name\" android:networkSecurityConfig=\"@xml/network_security_config\" android:supportsRtl=\"true\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Cordova 9.0 (cordova-android 8.0.0) project, the AndroidManifest.xml leads\r\n```\r\n    <application android:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\" android:icon=\"@mipmap/ic_launcher\" android:label=\"@string/app_name\" android:networkSecurityConfig=\"@xml/network_security_config\" android:supportsRtl=\"true\">\r\n```\r\nThe results are same.\r\n\r\nPlease remove `node_modules`, `package-lock.json` when you removing android platform, adding it again  =||= Yeah, without any plugins it may work. But when some plugin add their own `edit-config` or `config-file` cordova mess up the final AndroidManifest.xml. Even if those `edit-config` are not related to each other still issues arises.\r\n\r\nLately, I'm facing issues even with cordova-8 now. I have a plugin which add tons of new lines to AndroidManifest.xml by using config-file. Then this xml-security edit-config mess it up, dropping sequential lines from resulting AndroidManifest.xml on each build. I mean, it drops a (random?) line when I build, lets say L50. I restore that dropped line, then on next build it drops L51. =||= @gartorware Thanks. I think the typical situation in which i can reproduce this issue is following.\r\n```\r\n$ cordova create sampleProject\r\n$ cd sampleProject\r\n$ cordova platform add android\r\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera\r\n```\r\nThen we found the `platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml ` as\r\n```\r\n<!-- list1 -->\r\n    <application android:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\" android:icon=\"@mipmap/ic_launcher\" android:label=\"@string/app_name\" android:supportsRtl=\"true\">\r\n        <activity android:configChanges=\"orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale\" android:label=\"@string/activity_name\" android:launchMode=\"singleTop\" android:name=\"MainActivity\" android:theme=\"@android:style/Theme.DeviceDefault.NoActionBar\" android:windowSoftInputMode=\"adjustResize\">\r\n            <intent-filter android:label=\"@string/launcher_name\">\r\n                <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\r\n                <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\r\n            </intent-filter>\r\n        </activity>\r\n        <provider android:authorities=\"${applicationId}.provider\" android:exported=\"false\" android:grantUriPermissions=\"true\" android:name=\"org.apache.cordova.camera.FileProvider\">\r\n            <meta-data android:name=\"android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS\" android:resource=\"@xml/camera_provider_paths\" />\r\n        </provider>\r\n    </application>\r\n```\r\nwhere the `provider` directive is added by camera plugin.\r\n\r\nThen I edit config.xml to add\r\n```\r\n<!-- list2 -->\r\n        <edit-config file=\"AndroidManifest.xml\" target=\"/manifest/application\" mode=\"merge\">\r\n            <application android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\" />\r\n        </edit-config>\r\n```\r\nin `<platform name=\"android\">` directive. Then do `cordova prepare` again.\r\n\r\nWe expect this to add `android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\"` attribute in `application` directive.\r\n\r\nHowever, the resulting `AndroidManifest.xml` is\r\n```\r\n<!-- list3 -->\r\n    <application android:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\" android:icon=\"@mipmap/ic_launcher\" android:label=\"@string/app_name\" android:supportsRtl=\"true\" android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\">\r\n        <activity android:configChanges=\"orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale\" android:label=\"@string/activity_name\" android:launchMode=\"singleTop\" android:name=\"MainActivity\" android:theme=\"@android:style/Theme.DeviceDefault.NoActionBar\" android:windowSoftInputMode=\"adjustResize\">\r\n            <intent-filter android:label=\"@string/launcher_name\">\r\n                <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\r\n                <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\r\n            </intent-filter>\r\n        </activity>\r\n    </application>\r\n```\r\nWe found\r\n1) The `android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\"` attribute in `application` directive is added as we expect.\r\n2) The `provider` directive in `application` disappears. This is contrary to expectations. =||= This happens because both `edit-config` in `config.xml` and  `config-file` in `plugin.xml` are going to update the same `application` directive in `AndroidManifest.xml` and then they conflict. \r\nThe logic in `cordova-common` can not resolve this conflict and apply the only one which takes high priority. In this case, `edit-config` in `config.xml` takes high priority.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue,  we must introduce the logic to resolve this kind of conflict programatically. =||= If we resolved conflict, there is another difficulty.\r\n1) If we remove `edit-config` directive in `config.xml`, the `AndroidManifext.xml` should be back to the previous one. \r\n2) If we remove `camera` plugin, the `AndroidManifest.xml` should become to the one in which only `edit-config` in `config.xml` is applied.\r\n =||= Im facing this issue after upgrading to cordova 9.0.0 with cordova android 8.0.0\r\nThis issue seems to be solved in this post.\r\nCan I know how to get these changes =||= I still seem to have this issue with Cordova 10 =||= "], ["96", "Can't tap to edit on input text on Android 9 Pie", "Didin Jamaludin", "didinj", "04/10/19, 05:22:49 PM", "# Bug Report\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\n### What is expected to happen?\r\nInput text should working normally as previous Cordova version (@8.0.0)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does actually happen?\r\nCan't tap to edit or fill input text in the login form on Android 9 Pie.

Do we actually need to do that, when we host the typings ourselves? Updating those version numbers would add an extra step to the release process (and surely be forgotten from time to time). So if they are not _needed_ for our self hosted typings, I would rather leave them out.\r\n\r\n2. Also:\r\n\r\n- Are there tools to create these typings automatically?\r\n- Are there tools to check if the typings are current and valid somehow?\r\n\r\n3. We need some documentation that is more than \"ask @timbru31\" so that we can properly support those typings as part of our core plugins, and maybe even give guidance to plugin authors why and how to include them in theirs. Should this live in the general plugin documentation in our main docs?", "> * In [apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar#132](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar/pull/132) the question came up of including the plugin version number in the typings themselves.\r\n> [...]\r\n\r\nI would personally downvote that idea. I think that dependent code should be able to code to the interface without regard to what version of the plugin it is using.\r\n\r\n> * Are there tools to create these typings automatically?\r\n\r\nIf the source code is JSDoc annotated, I have seen some tools that will generate the `.d.ts`:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/englercj/tsd-jsdoc\r\n- https://github.com/otris/jsdoc-tsd\r\n- https://github.com/fivetran/typescript-closure-tools (Closure being a style of JSDoc)\r\n\r\nI would generally favor using JSDoc with types for the multiple benefits of maintainability, clarity, and [Type Safe JavaScript with JSDoc](https://medium.com/@trukrs/type-safe-javascript-with-jsdoc-7a2a63209b76) (article by @rbiggs). =||= > I think that dependent code should be able to code to the interface without regard to what version of the plugin it is using.\r\n\r\nMy formulation might not have been clear enough: The version number is only included in a comment at the beginning of the file, to indicate which version the definitions apply to. There is nothing blocking the use of the definitions with mismatched version number or anything.\r\n\r\nDisadvantage is that this creates a new mandatory release step because that number of course has to be incremented with each release. =||= Well, I agree that such a comment should not exist since naturally the typings in the plugin package apply to the version of the plugin that is in the package which is the version of the package. Easy :) =||= For definitions hosted on DefinitelyTyped it makes sense to add a version number, because there is a loose coupling with the code. You can update those packages independently. \r\n\r\nIn the situation where the definitions are part of the code repo/packages it does not make sense to add a version number, as there is a hard link with the version of the code in that same package.\r\n\r\nSo in the Cordova case I would go for not having a version number in there. =||= Just went through all our plugins with types and removed the plugin version numbers.\r\n\r\n =||= "], ["104", "[Plugins] Release all the plugins: Release current master", "Jan Piotrowski", "janpio", "07/11/19, 04:03:06 PM", "Our plugins need releases. \r\n\r\nFirst step is to [update CI configuration so current platforms are tested](https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/38), fix all the bugs that are discovered and then do a release of `master` as a patch or minor release if possible.\r\n\r\n### 1.

Maybe other people will find this issue via Google and be thankful for instructions.\r\n\r\nIs this something we should bring up with Angular to better support somehow? =||= Hi,\r\n We have fixed the issue by adding \"type=text/javascript\" in index.html after creation of .dist file.\r\n\r\nBecause of angular differential loading runtime.js, polyfill.js gets added to indexl.html file and they have a TYPE=MODULE but \"type=text/javascript\" is not there (it would be helpful if it is included) hence web browser dose not have any issue identifying the MIME type but if we built an apk or ipa using the same .dist through cordova then Android native is not able to identify the MIME type hence the error is thrown.\r\n\r\nThanks. =||= Oh that is very interesting!\r\n\r\nCan you point me to some documentation about this \"differential loading\" in Angular 8? (I know very little about Angular, so I would be interested in learning a bit more to udnerstand how exactly this works.) Maybe we can create a PR for Angular to fix this permanently. =||= > Oh that is very interesting!\r\n> \r\n> Can you point me to some documentation about this \"differential loading\" in Angular 8?

This solution worked for me. =||= > Is this actually resolved?\r\n&mdash; @juristr\r\n\r\n> Any ideas why this has been closed?\r\n&mdash; @tscislo\r\n\r\nThe Android WebView used by Cordova loads files via `file://` URLs. However, [the MDN guide on modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#Other_differences_between_modules_and_standard_scripts) states that:\r\n> You need to pay attention to local testing \u2014 if you try to load the HTML file locally (i.e. with a `file://` URL), you'll run into CORS errors due to JavaScript module security requirements. You need to do your testing through a server.\r\n\r\nYou can also go ahead and try to open the minimal reproduction that @jamcoupe posted (thanks, by the way) directly from the file system with Chrome. It will give a `net::ERR_FAILED` when trying to load the script with `type=\"module\"`. Since the Android WebView is Chrome, there's little we can do about this issue.\r\n\r\nThat means, that configuring your build to not use `type=\"module\"` is the correct solution here. =||= "], ["137", "cordova -v command display bug", "Feng Guo", "justwezzz", "07/08/19, 02:31:59 PM", "![\u6355\u83b7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1901634/60602892-46107280-9de7-11e9-9ea6-2a28578d20bf.PNG)\r\n\r\nafter update cordova\uff0cthe cordova -v command still display old version\u3002", "What does `npm list -g --depth=0` return? =||= @janpio \r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1901634/60632251-39b40600-9e37-11e9-998a-d391eadf966d.png)\r\n =||= And `cordova -v` still returns the wrong version?

Reverse DNS notation is what is commonly used in java/android land.

The files inside your cordova `www` folder are being loaded directly from the filesystem, so no network is involved here. If anything, I think  this will result of longer loader times because it needs to compress and then decompress before the browser can start parsing. =||= Hi @breautek,\r\nwe then get some faster downloads of the final app from the stores.\r\nApp size is reduced overall using Gzip/Deflate.\r\nWhile added loading times are marginal so it's a win-win.\r\nFiles are compressed and packaged in the app beforehand, so no need to compress them on the fly,\r\nonly the decompression is required.\r\nWe should have the option to do it like in previous versions.\r\nSmall size files are necessary for mobile Apps. =||= I see. This would require significant changes on the native side of each platform. The browser gzip functionality is part of their network stack, so it is not used when files are being loaded from the filesystem, which means each native implementation would have to include a gzip implementation and override resource loading (if that is even possible)\r\n\r\n I don't consider this a win-win, especially for the level of maintenance (high-risk to be app-breaking if something goes wrong) that would be required in the future.\r\n\r\n> We should have the option to do it like in previous versions.\r\n\r\nCordova has never had a feature that compresses the `www` directory or any file inside that directory. It simply copies the files to the native app project that it manages for you. \r\n\r\nCordova can use a remote URL as it's content loading point, and the webserver can use gzip so perhaps this is what you were thinking about, but this is **NOT** the recommended approach for final deployments, as it can be a reason for app rejection from the app stores.\r\n\r\nDon't forget that, at least on android, APKs are already compressed (they are simply zip files afterall). I think it's safe to assume that the iOS IPA files are also compressed, though I don't know for sure.\r\n\r\nIf you want this kind of functionality, it would be better suited as a cordova plugin.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons above, I'll be closing this ticket. =||= "], ["195", "Cordova apk returning : the server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of \"\"", "Pigeon", "fabrizio03", "02/05/20, 07:36:08 PM", "I am new with cordova and hybrid apps but I have been trying to fix this problem for a lot.\r\nI'm building an apk using cordova, when I try it as html/css/js I use a simple python script to start a server, but I get this error when I try to import a js module from html:\r\n\r\n`<script type=\"module\">import * as assistantinhelper from './__target__/assistantin.js'; window.assistantinhelper = assistantinhelper;</script>`", "NaN"], ["196", "Cordova apk returning : the server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of \"\"", "Pigeon", "fabrizio03", "05/05/20, 09:25:28 PM", "I am new with cordova and hybrid apps but I have been trying to fix this problem for a lot.\r\nI'm building an apk using cordova, when I try it as html/css/js I use a simple python script to start a server, but, on android, I get this error when I try to import a js module from html:\r\n`<script type=\"module\">import * as assistantinhelper from './__target__/assistantin.js'; window.assistantinhelper = assistantinhelper;</script>`\r\n\r\nI should have installed the latest version of cordova, I'm trying my app on a galaxy A3 2017\r\n\r\nI am also using Transcrypt to 'translate' some python scripts to javascript:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Transcrypt'ed from Python, 2020-02-05 19:59:53\r\nimport {AssertionError, AttributeError, BaseException, DeprecationWarning, Exception, IndexError, IterableError, KeyError, NotImplementedError, RuntimeWarning, StopIteration, UserWarning, ValueError, Warning, __JsIterator__, __PyIterator__, __Terminal__, __add__, __and__, __call__, __class__, __envir__, __eq__, __floordiv__, __ge__, __get__, __getcm__, __getitem__, __getslice__, __getsm__, __gt__, __i__, __iadd__, __iand__, __idiv__, __ijsmod__, __ilshift__, __imatmul__, __imod__, __imul__, __in__, __init__, __ior__, __ipow__, __irshift__, __isub__, __ixor__, __jsUsePyNext__, __jsmod__, __k__, __kwargtrans__, __le__, __lshift__, __lt__, __matmul__, __mergefields__, __mergekwargtrans__, __mod__, __mul__, __ne__, __neg__, __nest__, __or__, __pow__, __pragma__, __proxy__, __pyUseJsNext__, __rshift__, __setitem__, __setproperty__, __setslice__, __sort__, __specialattrib__, __sub__, __super__, __t__, __terminal__, __truediv__, __withblock__, __xor__, abs, all, any, assert, bool, bytearray, bytes, callable, chr, copy, deepcopy, delattr, dict, dir, divmod, enumerate, filter, float, getattr, hasattr, input, int, isinstance, issubclass, len, list, map, max, min, object, ord, pow, print, property, py_TypeError, py_iter, py_metatype, py_next, py_reversed, py_typeof, range, repr, round, set, setattr, sorted, str, sum, tuple, zip} from './org.transcrypt.__runtime__.js';\r\nvar __name__ = '__main__';\r\nexport var assistantinkeydown = function (element, event) {\r\n\tvar key = event.keyCode;\r\n\tif (key == 13) {\r\n\t\telement.value = '';\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n\r\n//# sourceMappingURL=assistantin.map\r\n```", "A [minimal, reproducible example ([1])](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) on most recent Cordova update is needed for this kind of an issue.\r\n\r\nUsing Transcript sounds really nice but not something we provide direct support for.\r\n\r\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example =||= `<script type=\"module\">` requires that the file to be served from a http server because because it is forced through the CORS protocol.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you are receiving this module from the server, but the provided error suggest that the server is sending an incorrect `Content-Type` header.

Thanks for trying to help! =||= Hi there, I've finally got around to investigate this a bit.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is failing is because two things are overriding the `addEventListener` API.\r\n\r\n`zone-evergreen.js` does so at using this function: https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/b11bd466c20dc338b6d4d5bc3e59868ff263778d/dist/zone-evergreen.js#L1806\r\n\r\n`zone-evergreen.js` is kind of complicated, so I'm not sure at what point it actually overrides the `addEventListener` function, I just know that it does. AB testing both versions in your reproduction app shows the event leads to `platform-browser.js:395` (angular framework code) \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naddEventListener(element, eventName, handler) {\r\n    const plugin = this._findPluginFor(eventName);\r\n    return plugin.addEventListener(element, eventName, handler);\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nWhere on non-cordova, `plugin.addEventListener` method points to the function defined to `zone-evergreen.js` posted above,\r\n\r\nand on Cordova, the function points to https://github.com/apache/cordova-browser/blob/3b077ad590adc6f53a93b8af98efb20f8b1caeb7/cordova-lib/cordova.js#L123\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndocument.addEventListener = function (evt, handler, capture) {\r\n    var e = evt.toLowerCase();\r\n    if (typeof documentEventHandlers[e] !== 'undefined') {\r\n        documentEventHandlers[e].subscribe(handler);\r\n    } else {\r\n        m_document_addEventListener.call(document, evt, handler, capture);\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, Cordova overrides the addEventListener method to handle some cordova-specific events, such as `deviceready`, `pause`, `resume`, and `activated`. Cordova **will** fallback to the original implementation of `addEventListener` if the incoming event isn't a cordova-defined event. However, unfortunately that original implementation is a reference to the native `addEventListener` and not Angular's/Zone replacement implementation.\r\n\r\nBasically this means angular never receives events such as `mousemove`.\r\n\r\nPersonally I see this as bad practice on both sides, no one should be touching/replacing native functions. This case is a prime example of the why. But obviously these are decisions well baked into both frameworks and is incredibly hard to change without virtually breaking every single project using the framework. This means Angular and Cordova doesn't really support each other (in a nice way, see the workaround).\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nI tried moving the `cordova.js` script tag so it's loaded after the angular framework. I also had to remove the `defer` attribute on the angular script tags to ensure that are loaded and executed first. This will make Cordova store a reference to the modified `addEventListener` interface rather than the browser's native function. This appears to work but mileage may vary. I'm not sure if this will break anything else, but I don't see deviceready not invoked 5 second warning, so *that's a good sign*.\r\n\r\nBecause I don't believe Cordova will change anything in relation to this, I'll be closing this issue. =||= "], ["229", "Can't set minSdkVersion when building for Android 9.0.0", null, "rookieleader", "07/16/20, 02:06:05 PM", "<!--\r\nPlease have a look at the issue templates you get when you click \"New issue\" in the GitHub UI.\r\nWe very much prefer issues created by using one of these templates.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Issue Type\r\n<!-- Please check the boxes by putting an x in the [ ] like so: [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Report\r\n- [ ] Feature Request\r\n- [ ] Support Question\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWhen trying to build debug release for android 9.0.0 it fails with a minSdkVersion message set to 21 where 22 minimum is expected although I tried almost all possible way to set it to 22 or above (Gradle.properties, Androidmanifest.xml, config xml, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Information\r\nError when building :\r\n\r\n```> Task :app:processDebugManifest FAILED\r\n/app/logistique/platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml Error:\r\n        uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 21 cannot be smaller than version 22 declared in library [:CordovaLib] /app/logistique/platforms/android/CordovaLib/build/intermediates/library_manifest/debug/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 21\r\n        Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 21,\r\n                or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 22,\r\n                or use tools:overrideLibrary=\"org.apache.cordova\" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)\r\n\r\nSee http://g.co/androidstudio/manifest-merger for more information about the manifest merger.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\r\n\r\n* What went wrong:\r\nExecution failed for task ':app:processDebugManifest'.\r\n> Manifest merger failed : uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 21 cannot be smaller than version 22 declared in library [:CordovaLib] /app/logistique/platforms/android/CordovaLib/build/intermediates/library_manifest/debug/AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 21\r\n        Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 21,\r\n                or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 22,\r\n                or use tools:overrideLibrary=\"org.apache.cordova\" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)\r\n\r\n* Try:\r\nRun with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.

main plugin itself.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that, if it hasn't removed, I cannot attempt to do `cordova plugin add --link --nosave xxx` as my next step.\r\n\r\n### What is expected to

dependencies.  \r\n\r\n### What does actually happen?\r\n\r\nRemoval seems to partially fail (I haven't figured out if it is only when plugin dependencies have dependencies themselves, so I'll have to

Problem\r\n\r\nI have an express server which has an API endpoint of /todo/set which gets a JSON, POST request. This API uses cors.\r\n\r\nThe API's working, it's tested with Postman (On same computer and on another computer on same LAN) and it's working with fetch (JavaScript) when using a browser (both on phone and computer). Tried to check it both with only running Svelte server and using cordova browser platform.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, When using Cordova android application, the fetch is returning \"TypeError: Failed to fetch\" and the server is not getting the request.\r\n\r\nThis is the code for example:\r\n```\r\nfetch(`http://localhost:8080/todo/set`, {\r\n    method: \"post\",\r\n    body: JSON.stringify({\r\n        'Text': 'Test!'\r\n    }),\r\n    headers: {\r\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\r\n    }\r\n}).then(res => alert(res)).catch(err => alert(err))\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Tried to replace the \"localhost\" with my local IP. Same issue. \r\n* The code is the same for the phone application and the website, I'm just running it differently (`cordova run android` vs `cordova run browser`).\r\n\r\n### What is expected to happen?\r\nThe server had to get the request at least.\r\n\r\n### What does actually happen?\r\nThrowing an error and the server is not getting any request.\r\n\r\n## Information\r\nPosted it also on StackOverflow, Maybe it's a little more clear there: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65864040/typeerror-failed-to-fetch-only-on-cordova-application\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\n- Create a local express server and try to fetch json data from it via Cordova android applicatoin. \r\n\r\n### Environment, Platform, Device\r\n- Developing on Arch Linux.\r\n- The application is for android phone, Samsung Note 9 specifically\r\n\r\n### Version information\r\n- Using Svelte for Frontend 3.0.0\r\n- Cordova 10.0.0\r\n- Cordova platform LS:\r\n```\r\nInstalled platforms:\r\n  android 9.0.0\r\n  browser\r\n```\r\nI'm using a clone of this repository for the application development: https://github.com/BenTimor/SvelteCordova\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [X] I searched for existing GitHub issues\r\n- [X] I updated all Cordova tooling to most recent version\r\n- [X] I included all the necessary information above\r", "If you're testing on a physical device, then `localhost` is not going to work, as that refers to the local device  (aka the phone itself), which I assume the server isn't running on.\r\n\r\nYou need to make sure the following:\r\n- the server is bound to a reachable ip address.

So cordova's mandatory JDK-8 is when i work with mobile change to system enviroment ...etc. We need a set JDK location by run cordova. \r\n\r\n## Feature Description\r\nNormally we are run cordova with (example);\r\n`cordova run android`\r\nBut cordova says;\r\n`Requirements check failed for JDK 8 ('1.8.*')! Detected version: 11\r\nCheck your ANDROID_SDK_ROOT / JAVA_HOME / PATH environment variables.`\r\nif we can run with a specified JDK location, like;\r\n`cordova run android -jdk C:/oldJava/jdk8/bin`\r\nWe can use multiple JDK versions will be more useful for cli commands\r\n\r\n\r\n## Alternatives or Workarounds\r\nThere is no alternative. I was searched (google, stackoverflow and documents).\r\n\r\n\r", "I think it's safe to say that everyone in the Cordova team would be happy if we could stop having to require JDK 8. We always have inherited this requirement from the Android tooling. While it seems that it might finally be possible to use a newer JDK with Android tooling, there's a lot to watch out for with your setup and there would still be changes to be made to cordova-android. We probably will get there eventually, but it is just not a top priority right now.\r\n\r\nI do not think we want to introduce a command line option to set the JDK. There is a simple workaround: setting `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables. In POSIX shells (e.g. Git Bash) this could look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport JAVA_HOME=C:/oldJava/jdk8\r\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Windows `cmd` (untested):\r\n```\r\nset JAVA_HOME=C:/oldJava/jdk8\r\nset PATH=%JAVA_HOME%/bin;%PATH%\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, all commands in this shell session will use the updated environment variables. So you can just use `cordova run android`. You can also change environment variables per command. The complexity of that varies depending on your shell.\r\n\r\nOn Unix-like operating system (macOS, Linux, \u2026) you can nicely automate this process using [direnv](https://direnv.net/). I just put above commands inside a `.envrc` file in the projects that use `cordova-android` and `direnv` applies the changes to the environment variables whenever I change into that directory.\r\n\r\nOf course you can also write a little helper script named `usejdk8` that changes the environment. =||= Just wanted to note that current AS alpha preview uses java 11, so soon.... we will be able to upgrade to java 11.
