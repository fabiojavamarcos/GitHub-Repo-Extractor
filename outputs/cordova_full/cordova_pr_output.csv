The very important question: **When are we going to release Cordova 9?**

Also adding @dpogue to this question. 

Looking at the project board, https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/2 and the previously agreed item from the dev mailing list, all the items for Cordova 9 release appears to have been completed with a few exceptions (package-lock.json, ...). But now it seems the scope is expanding. 

I am hoping we are not increasing the scope and delaying Cordova 9 release for items that may not be important, or can be release in a minor.

Can we list out what are the remaining items and why?

- Android P had already been officially released since August 6, 2018.
- iOS 12 and Xcode 10 is already officially released.
 
I want to prevent scope creeping if necessary. =||= My list of remaining items looks something like this:

* **Bridge WebView plugin for UIWebView/WKWebView**
* **Update Xcode Project to be compatible with Xcode 10**
  (WIP at https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/pull/409, but this needs more testing)
* **iOS Cocoapod improvements**
  (WIP at https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues/391, ready to merge?)
* **Updating Android gradle files to not use deprecated commands**
  (PR at https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/486, waiting for someone who understands gradle to review)
* **Updating Android gradle version to latest to deal with incompatibilities with newest NDK tools**
  (See https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/issues/504, again need someone who understands gradle) =||= @dpogue 

**The CocoaPods improvement** is done and can be merged in now. 
1. Merge `cordova-common` PR
2. Release `cordova-common` next major tagged `3.0.0`.
3. Update `cordova-ios` package.json with `cordova-common@^3.0.0`
4. Merge `cordova-ios` CocoaPods PR

Is the **Android Gradle's latest version** actually a requirement for this next major? Without the latest version, does Android P builds fails? This task seems new and unexpectedly added.

I already reviewed **Updating Android gradle files to not use deprecated commands** and said that the changes were OK. The question I left as a comment only asked if we should allow developers the flexibility to pick between `implementation` and `api`. Adding the support is not required for next major. 

I knew there were **other Gradle PRs** that had questions about adding the helper methods into the dependencies scope to better isolate features that not everyone uses for example Kotlin and EnableGoogleServicesPlugin.
https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/438
https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/pull/441 =||= I think the issue with the Android Gradle latest version is that the current projects are not compatible with the latest Android Studio.

I believe newer versions of gradle are now warning that `compile` support will be dropped at the end of 2018, and the work to update to `implementation` is already done, so I think we should get this in the next major. With regards to `implementation` vs `api`, I think at the app level `implementation` makes sense. =||= I stand to what I have said on the mailing list: 

> I think we just have to start the process. We have to do the releases in order anyway and there is the [buy-in phase][1] for each release, so any blockers will surface when it's the turn of the respective repo. The first release that would have to be done is `cordova-common`.

That being said, I have no capacities to do any release management myself right now.

Things that should be resolved before the respective major release:

- For platforms: https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/32
- https://github.com/apache/cordova-fetch/pull/44 (basically finished; would appreciate another review)
- https://github.com/apache/cordova-fetch/issues/47 (would like some opinions before we release the new major)
- Do the deprecation-part of https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/issues/689

Regarding committing `package-lock.json`: Since there was little feedback after the latest concerns I would still assume consensus for the original plan. However, we might as well postpone this task to any following release, since the presence of `package-lock.json` [affects development only](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c06d35b6944fb44a04449a7baf10797f8ae11cbcfddb3e90851dc0b9@%3Cdev.cordova.apache.org%3E) anyway.

[1]: https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/tools-release-process.md#get-buy-in =||= @raphinesse I will try to take a look at those tickets tomorrow that you linked for review and opinions.
 
- For https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/32, I also seen this. I looked into it before and it should be a one liner to delete.

- As for the `package-lock.json`, IMO I would commit it. I don't really experience the negative affects that everyone else seems experience so much. I have actually seen more positive cases. For example: the recent CI tests failure because one of the dependency updated and it had an issue. Locally, it passed because I had the lock. Anyways its just my opinion. =||= @erisu Yes, #32 should be straightfwd. Just needs to be done, and I'm already distracting myself too much :sweat_smile:.

Re package-lock: I don't care either way for the coming release. Downside is, it's another thing to be done.

I forgot about https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/50 in my previous post. Would be nice to have this in the coming release. I think it's good to go as is, but its verification has been stalled by our uncovering of various Windows issues. Since `cordova-common` will be the first release to do, our schedule might be too tight to squeeze in this change. =||= I can start #32 tomorrow as well and put in the PRs for review etc. So you don't distract too much :) =||= `cordova-common@3.0.0` has been published, which checks off step 1 from the list. =||= I just raised <https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/pull/721> with a proposal for cordova-lib to export the Cordova `common` object, so that Cordova CLI should not need `cordova-common` in its dependencies. This proposal should reduce the chance of violating the [cordova-common singleton rule](https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/tools-release-process.md#cordova-common-singleton-rule). I hope we can get this kind of enhancement into Cordova 9. =||= I think it would be ideal if we can squeeze in a couple more updates to `cordova-common` before Stage 2, in order to use real singletons instead of following the [cordova-common singleton rule](https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/tools-release-process.md#cordova-common-singleton-rule):
* Refactor CordovaLogger to a singleton class - approved PR in <https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/53>
* Refactor CordovaEvents to a singleton class as discussed in <https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/53#issuecomment-443561178> =||= @brodybits Since `cordova-common@3`, for Cordova 9, had already been released, I don't think we need to focus on this. The discussion [thread 1](http://mail-archives.us.apache.org/mod_mbox/cordova-dev/201812.mbox/%3CCAPmt4D3UPNzbB6B8pT63wkEJpoin8pwXwDtXs44S1MEr=afbhw@mail.gmail.com%3E) and [thread 2](http://mail-archives.us.apache.org/mod_mbox/cordova-dev/201812.mbox/%3CCAPmt4D1Bdve6VvJV1Y3HMEZUg7Qh52ChdAd=11xFbz2bFiH6LA@mail.gmail.com%3E) is focused on

- cordova-js
- cordova-fetch
- cordova-serve
- cordova-app-hello-world

I am trying to move forward on the Cordova 9 release and stop delaying or scope creeping way too much. For example, this was never a part of the original roadmap or even a hint as future work.

Additionally, as @dpogue commented 
> I don't think this actually requires anything more than a patch release

Since we are pining `cordova-common@^3.0.0` and we do not commit `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` (for most packages) this means the the patch released would take affect immediately without releasing new tools. =||= **Stage 2 Progress Report:**

The following tools and template has been published and its corresponding [release blog post](https://cordova.apache.org/news/2018/12/25/tools-release.html) has also been posted.

Thanks!

> Have you finished preparing the `cordova-node-xcode@2.0.0` release?

I am still working on it, see <https://github.com/apache/cordova-node-xcode/issues/20>. If you need it sooner please feel free to publish it yourself and I can continue my work afterwards.

I have also made cordova-common@3.1.0 which uses real singletons, waiting for a couple reviews before publishing. =||= FYI the [cordova-common singleton rule](https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/tools-release-process.md#cordova-common-singleton-rule) no longer applies since I published `cordova-common@3.1.0`, which should be included by the Cordova 9 packages. I just raised apache/cordova-coho#224 to note this in the tools release process.

@erisu I hope to publish xcode@2.0.0 in the next 1-2 weeks; please feel free to publish it now if you need it more quickly. =||= @brodybits I am planning to begin in the next 2-4 days the self-preparation for discussion & vote of the platform releases. 

As it stands, I am only targeting platforms that do not require `node-xcode`.

If `node-xcode` is released before, then I will include iOS and macOS to my list.

> please feel free to publish it now if you need it more quickly.

18Version pinning in Cordova CLI (via cordova-lib)Jan Piotrowskijanpio06/07/19, 07:51:18 PM"In https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/blob/master/src/platforms/platformsConfig.json Cordova ""pins"" a number of platforms to a specific version, that is used to install the platform is no other version is supplied. This behavior is also mentioned in several places in https://github.com/apache/cordova-coho/blob/master/docs/versioning-and-release-strategy.md.

The clear disadvantage of this behavior is that we need to do a release of `cordova-lib` (and `cordova-cli` that contains it) to update the pinned versions. Until then, people just running e.g. `cordova platform add android` will get an outdated version by default and (from experience on Stack Overflow, Ionic Forum and `support` issues here) have to be told regularly to update the platform when they encounter a bug (`cordova platform add android@7.1.1`) - it is just not really expected behavior for most users that the default command doesn't install the newest version.

1. Why do we need pinned versions?
1. What is the history behind this feature?
1. What are the advantages of it?
1. Does this behavior still make sense today?
1. Can we maybe get rid of it and replace it with ""will install `latest` by default, but can of course still be overridden by supplying a specific version"" in a future cli/lib version?""I guess the idea is that when you install an old version of Cordova, you get platform versions that are compatible with it, instead of the incompatible, latest version. =||= That might be have been a motivation.  
Is there no other mechanism to select a platform that actually works with the CLI version (or other way around: For a platform to require a Cordova CLI / cordova-lib version)?
Even then, is this worth the added hassle? Aren't there better mechanisms to achieve this? Especially as a removal would only affect future cli/lib releases? =||= In general, I'm not opposed to the mindset that you get a ""proven working"" combination of modules with whatever version of Cordova you're using and then updating those modules as desired.

I imagine this is similar to downloading an installer for a desktop application, which then installs an update right after the initial installation.

From your initial assessment, I would conclude that the actual issue is that the user will not realize that newer packages may be available. I would suggest leaving the version pinning in place and instead add update checks as applicable. Maybe along the lines of https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier

If that's not acceptable, I would prefer dropping version pinning and putting emphasis on the latest versions of the modules. The old versions of platforms and other modules are losing importance constantly, because technologies are deprecated and removed all the time. I don't even know what I could do today with a 2 year old Cordova version; pinned versions or not. So providing users with the best code possible (which should be the latest) should be preferred. =||= That's exactly where my thoughts come from: You would have to upgrade everything to make it work with modern iOS and Android. =||= > In https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/blob/master/src/platforms/platformsConfig.json

to a specific MAJOR+MINOR version using the `~` (tilde) character, which would still match if a patch is made on the same MAJOR+MINOR version.

I *think* some of the `semver` rules and features would apply if used by the user, would have to investigate and test to say for sure.

> 4\. Does this behavior still make sense today?

I think so.

Definitely should not use higher major version of a platform unless explicitly requested by user.

It *should* also be possible for Cordova to the platform to specific major only by using `^` (caret). I would personally not favor this by default. =||=

What ""user"" are you referring to here? The committer maintaining the file?

What does ""higher"" mean here? The user just runs `cordova platform add android` and expects to get the latest and greatest. =||= > I would suggest leaving the version pinning in place and instead add update checks as applicable. Maybe along the lines of yeoman/update-notifier

While I don't disagree, doesn't this ""just"" apply to the CLI itself (at least by common use of the tool) and not the platforms installed? 

Then it would obviously solving the problem of users still having an old Cordova CLI with old pinned versions installed. But the first `cordova platform add android` experience of a user would still be suboptimal unless we always keep the pinned versions up to date. Correct? =||= > Do you mean ""major or minor"" or ""major+minor"" here?

MAJOR+MINOR, just updated the comment above

Cordova CLI user =||= > While I don't disagree, doesn't this ""just"" apply to the CLI itself (at least by common use of the tool) and not the platforms installed?

I think you're right. I have not used that particular module in my own code. I just picked it as an illustration of what I had in mind: A non-intrusive way to notify the user about new versions. =||= >>> I think some of the semver rules and features would apply if used by the user
>>> [...]
>>
>> What ""user"" are you referring to here?
>
> Cordova CLI user

That might as well be, but is not relevant regarding the version pinning (meaning: default version installed when _no_ version is specified by the user, no exact version and no semver anything). Or did I misunderstand? =||= > The user just runs `cordova platform add android` and expects to get the latest and greatest.

I think ""latest"" should have been written with back-ticks (`latest`) since `latest` tag on npm generally means latest stable release (my understanding, at least).

If the Cordova CLI user would do `cordova platform add android@latest`, for example, then the Cordova CLI does the following (just tested with `cordova@8.0.0` package version):
* fetch `cordova-android@latest` from npm
* add `<engine name=""android"" spec=""latest"" />` to `config.xml` (this will go away in next major Cordova release)
* add `""cordova-android"": ""^7.1.1""` entry to `package.json`

I am coming around to favor that this should be the case by default, if the Cordova CLI user runs `cordova platform add android` for example. But this means that we better ensure that newer major release of Cordova platform packages will work with older major release of Cordova CLI, to a reasonable extent at least. =||= I actually really meant ""latest and greatest"" above, not any deeper specific meaning.
But: ""latest and greatest"" probably is `latest` on npm, so you are correct üëç 

> But this means that we better ensure that newer major release of Cordova platform packages will work with older major release of Cordova CLI, to a reasonable extent at least.

That of course is an absolute requirement, including the ability to config a platform release to only be installed in CLI versions it works with (meaning e.g. "">12.0.0"" or similar if that new platform only works with CLI 12 and newer because we changed something there).
 =||= @janpio What you describe in your last comment would usually be handled using `peerDependencies`. In this approach, a platform would specify that it needs one of a certain range of Cordova versions to be installed alongside it to work properly.

The problem here is that we recommend users to install tooling globally while platforms are installed locally. Moreover, we seem to support more than one workflow where platforms are used without `cordova-lib` (platform-centric with `plugman`, using only platforms and their scripts, ...) =||= > What you describe in your last comment would usually be handled using peerDependencies. In this approach, a platform would specify that it needs one of a certain range of Cordova versions to be installed alongside it to work properly.

Does this already work? Does this make sure, a platform requiring a newer ""interface"" doesn't get installed with older CLIs?

> The problem here is that we recommend users to install tooling globally while platforms are installed locally. Moreover, we seem to support more than one workflow where platforms are used without cordova-lib (platform-centric with plugman, using only platforms and their scripts, ...)

Ok, so does this answer the question I posed in my original post? Do we need the pinning because of that? =||= Sorry for not being clearer. When I wrote

> would usually be handled using `peerDependencies`

I meant that such a scenario would usually be handled using `peerDependencies` *in the npm eco-system*. The rest of my post describes why this is not easily achievable with how Cordova is currently laid out.

And yes, I think that the version pinning we do in `cordova-lib` is somewhat of a crutch to compensate for that. Whether we actually *need* it is quite subjective IMHO. =||= For the record: `cordova-lib@9` has relaxed the version pinning from `~` to `^` so as to allow minor updates of platforms to be propagated without publishing an update to the library. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

32Link `node_modules` during platform creation if it existsRaphael von der Gr√ºnraphinesse03/14/19, 03:37:59 PM"After removing bundled `node_modules` from platforms in #6, I noticed that the platforms unconditionally copy their (now potentially missing) bundled `node_modules` in their `create` scripts. Since they all use `shelljs` for that, it currently does not break the creation if `node_modules` but only causes an error message to be displayed.

Example from `cordova-android`:
https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/blob/8dfddef6f9f5d00fba591a2fbe8837ccebea49a7/bin/lib/create.js#L171

A recent conversation with @erisu made me realize that we actually *still* need to either copy or preferably link `<PROJECT>/node_modules/cordova-<PLATFORM>/node_modules` to `<PROJECT>/platforms/<PLATFORM>/node_modules` _if the former exists_. Otherwise Node's module resolution would not pick up the correct dependency versions for the platform in case of version conflicts.

#### Note
In the long run, we should probably try to have only native projects in `platforms` and keep the platforms' build scripts in the project's `node_modules` and run them from there. That should make things easier and cleaner IMHO.""@raphinesse 

1. Is it important/necessary to keep the platform binaries?

uncrustify.cfg
uncrustify.sh
update
update.bat
```

2. Can we remove them? Currently in question is `create`, but the rest can probably go as well.

I believe project creations is typically performed with Cordova CLI. I am not sure how many people actually create a project from the platform package.

# Purpose of the question
## The originating problems background
Once bundled dependencies were removed, when a platform is added, all of the dependencies are installed into the projects root directory, flattened. Therefore the copy command fails because the `node_modules/cordova-ios/node_modules` directory no longer exists.

## Removing the bug
Yes, the best solution is to remove the copy command but there are still test failures to resolve.

## The test failures
The failures are coming from `create.spec.js`, an e2e test file. The test uses the `create` binary to create a project. When creating a project, a path must be provided where the project will be created. In that folder, since the platform is being copied over and not installed via NPM, it needs the `node_modules` of the checked out platform to copy over. If it's not copied, it will fail later due to missing packages.

If I attempt to copy the `node_modules` directory into the temp project folder before it is called, create process will fail because it will appear as if the project already exists.

https://travis-ci.org/erisu/cordova-ios/jobs/433949167#L3190

## The question
Basically, there were two options that I can think of. If CLI `cordova platform add ios` is the typical pattern, should the ability to create a project from the platform be valid? If not it can be removed.

If we want to maintain this option, we can update the binary to pass in a flag within the options argument. The flag could be called `isNotCli: true`, and then update the copy node_modules line to come from the `__dirname` and only called when `isNotCli: true`. The reason for a negated option is so we do not need to update CLI code. 

Alternative flags could be: `isPlatformBin: true`, ... 

I am thinking the binaries can be removed and the tests using the binaries as well can be removed.

If you have any confusion let me know and I will try to clear it up. =||= @erisu Usually I'm all in favor of reducing the surface of Cordova's public API. However, there are people that actually use platforms on their own (see one of the old open PRs in cordova-lib) and while I myself never have users it before, this actually seems like a good feature to me.

In any case, I think it would be best to not remove any more stuff in next major.

That's all just a first impression. I really need to take a closer look to make an informed decision. I hope I'll be able to do that this weekend.

And please note the updates to the issue description I recently made. =||= An interesting problem (that we can defer for the moment) is that our dist packages won't have bundled node_modules anymore, so they won't run out-of-the-box.

Our release process is to generate tarballs and vote on them, and then publish those to npm, so we don't really want the node_modules folder to be in those packages at publish time, but we do want node_modules in the tarball that we make available for download from the website. =||= Is the tarball really a fully a supported distribution method (besides npm)? Does anybody use that? Why? =||= To work a project that consists of a single platform, using the `./bin/create` script from the tarball instead of cordova-cli. =||= OK. =||= From the description of this issue:

> we actually _still_ need to either copy or preferably link `<PROJECT>/node_modules/cordova-<PLATFORM>/node_modules` to `<PROJECT>/platforms/<PLATFORM>/node_modules` _if the former exists_. Otherwise Node's module resolution would not pick up the correct dependency versions for the platform in case of version conflicts.

The recent PRs by @erisu seem to ignore this fact. This is mandatory to not break module resolution. Or did you consider this and I am mistaken here? IMO, we need something like this in the create scripts:

```js
// ROOT is the platform module root
const platformDependencies = path.join(ROOT, 'node_modules');

if (fs.existsSync(platformDependencies)) {
  const localPlatformDependencies = path.join(project_path, 'cordova/node_modules');
  fs.ensureSymlinkSync(platformDependencies, localPlatformDependencies, 'junction');
}
```

That should fix things until we find time to do it the right way (just my opinion):
> In the long run, we should probably try to have only native projects in `platforms` and keep the platforms' build scripts in the project's `node_modules` and run them from there. That should make things easier and cleaner IMHO. =||= There are a bunch of similar-sounding problems here, and I think you've identified one and @erisu handled one, but they're not quite the same problem and it probably makes sense to try to identify all the problems:

1. **Existing released platforms need their node_modules copied when installing with the CLI**
  This *should* already happen, because the copy command is unconditionally in their project create scripts.

2. **Existing released platforms need their node_modules copied when installing using `bin/create` from a tarball**
  This is currently broken because the tarballs don't include node_modules, but I think it's out of our current scope to try to fix this for existing releases.

3. **Current platforms do not need their node_modules copied because they should match the CLI**
  But it's not safe to rely on this, which is what I believe @raphinesse is pointing out. See case 5 below.

4. **Current platforms need their node_modules copied when installing using `bin/create` from a tarball**
  @erisu fixed part of this by ensuring that the bin/create scripts will include the command to copy node_modules. One problem that still exists is that the tarball releases on dist don't actually include node_modules, but that's probably also out of scope for this particular discussion (it should, however, get raised for discussion in terms of our release process).

5. **Current platforms with a future CLI (or vice versa) need their node_modules copied when installing with the CLI**
  This is @raphinesse's point, that is the complication in case 3. If we install an older platform, its dependencies might not match the versions used by the CLI, so we would need to copy the nested node_modules folder to ensure we don't break module resolution.

The PRs from @erisu solve part of case 4, but we probably need to always copy node_modules if they exist to handle case 5.

Are there any additional edge cases that I've missed?

---

Doing this ""the right way"", and running the platform API scripts from the node_modules folder itself is definitely something we should eventually try to move towards, but we would still need to account for case 4 that requires copying everything. =||= Currently installing a platform from a local folder (e.g. `cordova platform add ""C:\Projects\cordova5\cordova-android"" --verbose`) is broken because of this subject:
https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/issues/362#issuecomment-443547612 =||= @raphinesse @dpogue Can this ticket be closed or are there still edge cases missing? =||= I don't really have a good grasp of the current state of things. But if all platforms behave like Android (if `node_modules` exists then copy it to platforms folder), I believe we are fine for the upcoming major release.

---

Adding a platform straight from a tarball is probably still broken for any platforms without bundled dependencies. However, I believe we should not support that workflow anymore. But that should be discussed in another issue targeting a future major release. =||= @raphinesse If I am correct, you're referring to the standalone non-CLI usage workflow? 

If I am correct, I believe we mentioned somewhere that an extra step to the current workflow is now required.

For users who use the tarball or GH repo for the standalone approach (non-CLI) must run `npm i  --only=prod` before running the `bin/create`. Then the create script would copy the `node_modules` folder into the platform folder as it has done in the past.

> **Side note**: It is  highly recommended to use the NPM packaged tarball from the Apache Distribution. It is not recommended to use the GH repo directly or the package tarball from GH release page as these may contain the `package-lock.json` and additional non-essential files. The Apache Distribution contains the official release package and accurate for production usage. It will never contain the `package-lock.json` and should not contain non-essential files.

Related to this post [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47926796/cordova-does-not-create-androidmanifest-xml?noredirect=1&lq=1](url), I tried downgrade to cordova  to CLI 7.1.0. It's OK but the plugin `ordova-background-geolocation-lt` needs cordova-android 7.0. Other solution is to use `Hooks` to delete file before installing plugins. But, I can't use this method with PhoneGap Build.


Thank by advance.""Phonegap CLI issues are over here: https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-cli/issues Please create an issue there if you are having problem with the Phonegap CLI. =||= On a more general note: The error looks like being caused by a plugin that still uses an old path that does not work with cordova-android 7.x. Are you installing the newest version of all plugins?

To solve this, I would suggest you create a new project with the newest CLI and cordova-android, then install the plugins manually with their newest versions. If everything works, you can just copy over your code.

Alternatively you can of course make sure to use the newest versions of everything to fix this. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0
46[Plugins] Android tests break when a new CLI is released that pins a new cordova-android version that requires a new Android target to be installedJan Piotrowskijanpio05/10/19, 10:13:58 PM"This is a rerun of a test, that passed 2 months before. So the exact same test, that used to pass, now does not any more: https://travis-ci.org/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts/jobs/431412788

The problem is that the plugin tests install the newest CLI with `npm install -g cordova`. If there is a new version of the CLI that pins a newer version of `cordova-android` that requires a newer Android target to be installed by default, this will fail as the Android targets to be installed are defined in `travis.yml`: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts/blob/99f9ea9ff94959c20a7823619744118725d09e31/.travis.yml#L60

So just by releasing a new CLI version with a new pinned `cordova-android`, we can make all the plugin tests for Android fail.
""Possible solution: 
Install a specific version of the CLI instead of just `npm install -g cordova`: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-contacts/blob/99f9ea9ff94959c20a7823619744118725d09e31/.travis.yml#L64 Disadvantage of that: All the `.travis.yml` files of the plugins have to be updated when a new CLI version is released.

Any other ideas? =||= Nothing we can do about it - either we have to specify the Android version, or the CLI version in the config. =||= I think having cordova-cli as a devDependency would be an easy and clean solution. Or is it only used in CI, not in local tests? =||= Yeah, this is about the Android SDK/tools version being installed by CI that has to be compatible with the pinned cordova-android version of Cordova CLI. New CLI release is automatically installed by CI, but CI config still uses older Android SDK. =||= Yes, but by specifying a semver range for the CLI in devDependencies that forbids major updates, that could be solved cleanly =||= Sorry, I might be missing something here:
Won't this limit what version of the CLI can be used with the plugin? 
The problem is not the plugin itself, which is perfectly fine with all Android SDK tooling (it is not relevant), but that the plugin CI has configured a specific Android SDK that can break when a new Cordova CLI is released. =||= > Won't this limit what version of the CLI can be used with the plugin?

Not, if you specify a version range as a devDependency or in the CI config as you previously suggested. After taking a quick look at the repo you linked, I'd say that installing a specific version in the CI config makes more sense in this case. =||= I still don't understand. Won't we have to make us update the config/package.json with each (major) CLI release vs. just sometimes when the pinned cordova-android requires a new Android SDK? =||= > Won't we have to make us update the config/package.json with each (major) CLI release vs. just sometimes when the pinned cordova-android requires a new Android SDK?

That is completely true. Sorry, I might have misunderstood you earlier.

Yes, we will have to decide whether we want to have scheduled maintenance at possibly shorter intervals or regular breakage at possibly longer intervals. I'd rather opt for the first alternative, but I see the appeal in the latter, given the amount of plugins.

IMHO the underlying problem here is that we have too much overhead for simple house keeping tasks. In this case, a mono repo for plugins would probably make things easier. =||= Ok, at least my understanding of the situation was correct.

Monorepo sounds nice in theory, in practice the even worse chaos in issues and PRs would offset these benefits by a lot.

I think for now we'll keep it like it is. Future updated to the Travis config can easily be scripted as I unified them over all plugins, so this shouldn't be too much work next time. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

@AndreasGassmann we would rather discuss that in a separate issue. But one thing: the error message is an attempt to communicate that we do not really want to support using ""requireCordovaModule"" to load non-Cordova module ""q"" any longer.

We can continue the discussion here now.""Interesting points @brodybits 

1) is good point, we will have to investigate if this is a real convention or just a thing we copied from somewhere and should be kept. 
The `GH-xxx` was actually just a crutch after we moved from JIRA to GitHub and didn't want to change the convention to much I think.

2) is indeed true. It is what GitHub does by default in the commit message when merging a PR via the ""Squash + Merge"" button, but it totally makes sense that we add the repository before that so it becomes explicit. (We should probably include that in some tooling that automates this)

3) is also caused by what GitHub does in the commit messages, also with JIRA we only linked the issue - not the PR - in the changelog which is why it might sense to continue to do this (prefix by issue ID if exists, suffix with PR ID always). But maybe we can also not link to the issue at all as all PRs should include a link to an issue (or be the issue at the same time) as well?

Other input? =||= > > (1) departure from convention [...]
>
> [...]
> The `GH-xxx` was actually just a crutch [...]

Agreed, and I find it to be an ugly one. I am really coming to favor to just use ""#???"" like GitHub does.

> > (2) just using `#???` [...]
>
> [...] It is what GitHub does by default in the commit message when merging a PR via the ""Squash + Merge"" button, but it totally makes sense that we add the repository before that so it becomes explicit.

I had only meant that a more explicit reference should be in the release notes in cordova-docs. But I said in <https://github.com/apache/cordova-docs/pull/911#issuecomment-440715086> that the more explicit reference may not be so important if a release notes page is all for the same package.

> > (3) moving the reference from the beginning to the end
>
> is also caused by what GitHub does in the commit messages

Yes.

Some of my early experience with GitHub merges came from watching the changes on PouchDB, and they seem to do some manual work to put the original PR number at the beginning of every commit before landing in the repo. A recent example is <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/7534>, which they landed in <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/commit/405e8d3710b518f36d026a619e16e59775d7b971>. (Earlier PouchDB PRs such as <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/pull/2900> were actually closed rather than merged since the GitHub merge tool was less advanced back then. And Node.js still seems to close accepted PRs with ""landed"" messages instead of actually merging them; <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/23163> is an example.)

I am starting to favor keeping the PR number at the end, like GitHub does by default, to make things easier. Committer should feel free to edit the merge commit message or not, as appropriate per PR.

> But maybe we can also not link to the issue at all as all PRs should include a link to an issue (or be the issue at the same time) as well?

I would favor that approach now. Not all PRs originate from separate issues, and some PRs may originate from issues in <https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues> (this project).

It's ok to allow breaking changes in Cordova for the sake of progress, but the following small change in `plugin.xml` structure would give plugin authors flexibility to support multiple cordova versions.

Has it been ever considered to allow multiple `<platform>` tags with version filters?

Short demo of what I mean in a plugin description file:

```xml
<plugin ...>
  <platform type=""android"" version=""<8.0.0"">
    ...
    <source-file src=""src/android/ILib.aidl"" target-dir=""src/com/android/vending/billing"" />

""Maybe"" should be ""definitely""; I would not favor making plugins do this. I just updated <https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/58> with this info. =||= Thanks @Jule-  This can do the job, but it might not be ideal to manage plugins version numbers.

This suggest, for example that the plugin has branches with version 1 that supports cordova-android@7 and version 2 that supports cordova-android@latest.

Then the plugin introduces an API change, it has to change major version. In order to keep supporting both cordova-android@7 and cordova-android@8 with the new plugin API, the plugin author has to create 2 new major releases. Like version 3 for cordova-android@7 and version 4 for cordova-android@8... What if the problem is multiplied with more different platforms?

It might be a little confusing, with different versions meaning either a change in supported platforms or a change in the plugin itself. =||= Closing in favor of <https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/58> =||= I am closing this ticket as previous comment said it would in favor for the other ticket.

Another thing would be consistent ordering of keys. [sort-package-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sort-package-json) can do that automatically. The ordering of the keys cannot be configured but it makes sense to me most of the time.

Right now I plan on doing two PRs (since the second one could be controversial):

- use short notation for `repository` field
- use short notation for `bugs` field

#### PR 2 
- set `author` field to ""Apache Software Foundation""
(This is what is used in most packages. How about using ""Apache Cordova Team"" instead?)
- remove `contributors` field
(@purplecabbage @dpogue You OK with that? You appear in at least some of them...)

If we agree on these changes up front, I could also throw these all into one PR per repo. Would be less work for everyone.

Regarding the sorting: I tried `sort-package-json` on one of our files and I don't really like the ordering it enforces. I found out that there's also https://www.npmjs.com/package/format-package which has a configurable ordering. But right now I would definitely postpone that part.

Some things I can think of right now:

General:

- no need to balance opening and closing tags (XML) or braces and brackets (JSON)
- more likely to have one item per line, easier to change one thing at a time without touching a lint that affects other things

Comparison to adding items to `package.json`:
- easier to add entries to the end of a list (no need to deal with commas)
- reduced risk that `npm` may reformat or otherwise edit non-npm items
- reduced risk of other forms of interference and other interaction with `npm`""(Explanation of -1: I really don't like YAML)

That's just an arbitrary multi-line string AFAICT. Not quite the same as an actual XML-Fragment or Node. These are also associated with a namespace. The way I see it, you would have to add the namespace in the YAML too or defer it from contextual information. =||= Gotta say I don't understand the issue in <https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/57#issuecomment-441734107>.

69androidx supportChris Brodybrodybits09/22/20, 11:51:51 AM"From discussion in apache/cordova-android#565 I think that `androidx` is not supported properly and needs to be improved. Described in a number of places including:
- <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51280090/what-is-androidx>
- <https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/> (with important info in <https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate>)
- <https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/05/hello-world-androidx.html>

In short: `androidx` Java packages replace use of `android` Java packages for ""unbundled"" Java packages, meaning part of the SDK and not part of the Android system libraries. Use of old ""unbundled"" Java packages seems to be deprecated, obsolete.

I tried to explain in apache/cordova-android#565 that this should not be an issue with the Cordova Android platform itself. I think we will have to update at least some of the plugins, though.

I am flagging this as a bug at the top level due to usability issues that I think have started to come to light in apache/cordova-android#565, especially with the PSPDFKit.

I would *personally* like to see this resolved before we finish the Cordova 9 release (#10). This is my personal opinion for the sake of usability and not to be interpreted as the official position of Apache Cordova.""> I would personally like to see this resolved before we finish the Cordova 9 release (#10).

Correct me if we've discovered otherwise, but I believe there is nothing to resolve **at the cordova-android level**, and therefore nothing that would delay Cordova 9. The changes for Android X need to happen in new major versions of the plugins, which is beyond the scope of the Cordova 9 release. =||= Well, I did a quick read and it looks like it just needs to target SDK 28, which I think it's already there. (I noticed this file still references 27, but not sure if it's used anymore https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/blob/master/framework/project.properties#L13)

And set two values to true in a `gradle.properties` file, which I can't find on Cordova projects, so not sure if we want to create it as default or leave the users do it themselves (probably not as it should go in projectName/platforms/android/ and everything there will be wiped).

Also we should try and see what happens when some plugins use the new ""support library"", and others the old one
 =||= > (I noticed this file still references 27, but not sure if it's used anymore https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/blob/master/framework/project.properties#L13)

I think that needs to be updated, will raise a PR with a better explanation. =||= > The changes for Android X need to happen in new major versions of the plugins, which is beyond the scope of the Cordova 9 release.

@dpogue I think this presents a problem for plugin authors such as myself since it is up to the Cordova project owner/plugin user as to whether they optionally enable AndroidX by manually adding the required properties to `gradle.properties` (see https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/350).

A reason they may choose not to enable AndroidX is that other 3rd-party Cordova plugins on which their project depends have not been updated for AndroidX - many popular 3rd party plugins are poorly maintained.

Therefore a new major plugin version that is updated for AndroidX will be ununsable in projects which have not been configured to use AndroidX: I can foresee a flood of issues opened against my plugins along the lines of ""AndroidX support broke my Cordova Android builds"". 

If the next major version of `cordova-android` configured AndroidX to be enabled by default, this would be less of an issue because plugin authors could use `<engines>` in the `plugin.xml` to restrict the new major plugin version to a minimum of that latest version of `cordova-android`.

In the meantime, I'm considering whether I can create a hook script which runs on plugin installation and depends on a plugin variable (i.e. `ANDROIDX_ENABLED=true|false`) which would dynamically replace the relevant class names in the Java source code and the `<framework>` elements in the `plugin.xml`.
This would enable a single version of my plugins to run both with or without AndroidX. =||= I've implemented a generic solution for AndroidX support in my plugins which reference the Android Support Library by creating a couple of new plugins:

- [cordova-plugin-androidx](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-androidx) will persistently configure a Cordova Android platform project to use AndroidX.
- [cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter) migrates any references to the legacy Support Library in a Cordova Android platform project to use the AndroidX equivalent names.

This means that by installing both of these plugins in a Cordova project that already contains plugins which reference either the legacy Support Library names and/or the AndroidX names, the build will now succeed.

For example, try this test case:

	cordova create test && cd test
	cordova platform add android@8
	cordova build android
		=> build succeeds
	cordova plugin add cordova.plugins.diagnostic
	cordova build android
		=> build succeeds
	cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-androidx
	cordova build android
		=> build fails
	cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter
	cordova build android
		=> build succeeds =||= wow, this is amazing, thanks @dpa99c! =||= Since the some users of my plugin use `PhoneGap Build` which does not support `hook scripts`, @dpa99c 's solution does not work. (And they always report to me)

I think most cloud build services do not support cordova hook scripts due to the security reason. =||= As far as I know only Phonegap Build doesn't support hooks.

The Android X support is ready, we just need to release cordova-android 9

But doesn't look like Phonegap Build is doing more updates in their servers, so the cordova-android 9 release won't help you. Check the adobe forums and you'll see dozens of topics about the iOS 13 SDK requirements not met by Phonegap Build and no official answer. =||= As we discuss `cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter` does not work on PhoneGap build.
It means this solution is not perfect for me.

That's why I re-created another plugin, which is written in `gradle` script.
[cordova-androidx-build](https://github.com/wf9a5m75/cordova-androidx-build)

The purpose of this plugin is little different from `cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter`.
`cordova-plugin-androidx-adapter` migrates the project code from `Android Support Libraries` to `AndroidX libraries`, which is one way.
This is OK for general developers. However plugin developers have to support both environments for a while (`cordova-android@8` and `cordova-android@9`).

That's why this plugin migrates from `AndroidX libraries` to `Android Support Libraries` if the environment does not support `AndroidX`.

And this plugin uses `Gradle` script, works on PC and cloud services.

## Description
I am using the FitBit API for integrating FitBit app in outsystems project. When user credentials entered and login is completed, just before the success page, I am getting an error page saying ""There was an error processing the request.Reload"". This page stays for few seconds and the login gets successful.This issue is happening in lower end Android devices. Why this reload screen is getting displayed?

### Context

I included node 7 here in the calculations which node version to drop, as it was EOL on 2017-06-30 already.

All data from the last 30 days, the absolute numbers don't really have a specific meaning, as well as ""Users"" is undefined. The relative data is the important bit.

---

The amount of users to be ""left behind"" would be similar to what we did/do with Cordova CLI 9, where we also remove ~8-10% of current and new user's node version.

So it would definitely hit a lot of people, but as this is based on official EOL and end of maintenance, this should be a positive thing for them.
 =||= As a nit-picking comment I would favor adding Node.js 12 and dropping Node.js 6 in separate commits in each repo. I would also favor adding Node.js 12 *before* dropping Node.js 6.

I think this would make it a little easier to cherry-pick the changes into a maintenance release branch if needed. =||= **Blog Announcement Reference:** https://github.com/apache/cordova-docs/pull/965

> 
> * iOS 9.3, 10.0 and 10.2
> * Android 4.4 and 5.0
> * Appium versions 1.7.2 and below on both iOS and Android

https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/2019/03/07/Announcing+End+of+Life+for+old+OS+versions+on+Sauce+emulators+and+simulators""Yes, it does: 

- Currently the plugins _only_ run iOS 9.3 and 10.0. 
- They also run Android 4.4.
- It seems we are also using Appium version 1.6.4 explicitly in some of the configurations

So: Jackpot.

Appium version can probably be configured via a PR to paramedic, but the actual OS versions being tested have to be configured in `.travis.yml` in each plugin repo. Yay. =||= First step is to update paramedic (our test runner) itself to actually support all relevant newer OS/version combinations and tests them itself: https://github.com/apache/cordova-paramedic/pull/97 =||= April 4th has gone, the mentioned device/version combinations still seem to work (sometimes). Well - lucky for us, as we haven't properly finished this. =||= Besides that, all xcode8 test will no longer work due to:
> Cordova needs xcodebuild version 9.0.0 or greater, you have version 8.0. Please install version 9.0.0 or greater from App Store

Why? Because the tests install `npm i -g cordova` and will receive CLI v9 which itself will install cordova-ios 5.0.0 which set the minimum version to Xcode9: https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/bin/templates/scripts/cordova/lib/check_reqs.js#L29

Some platforms had to be moved to future PRs as the tests are breaking on them, but that was more or less expected:

- apache/cordova-android#692 / apache/cordova-android#693

I previously had a similar experience when I tried to resolve the ""link copy"" issue, which is still open.

If someone has a suggestion on how to mitigate this issue in Cordova, I'd be glad to hear it. I currently see no other option than to implement a separate copy command that doesn't have an inode equality check (or a proper one). Which would be disappointing as that's the opposite of what you want when using such a library. =||= I can think of a couple ideas:

- try using built-in fs.copySync from Node.js (I cannot tell if it would break anything else or not without some testing and analysis)

Fs extra is about to release v8 with apparently a workaround for this issue. =||= Please take a look at the recent comments in apache/cordova-common#64, where you should see the answer so far.

Feel free to close either one. Thanks :)

## Problem
Using [ng-file-upload](https://github.com/danialfarid/ng-file-upload) it is not possible to upload images or document on Android when the App is built using Cordova.

The 2 lines fix suggested below will resolve the Issue opened [here](https://github.com/danialfarid/ng-file-upload/issues/2111) on the ng-file-upload repository and the [related Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55261705/file-upload-not-working-for-android-in-cordova-project).

This is the line after which the following 2 lines of code need to be added:
https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/blob/2163c8ae0536bfde9029cfc981b945f4af93e09f/framework/src/org/apache/cordova/engine/SystemWebChromeClient.java#L253

Bug fix - **2 lines of code**:
```
    @TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP)
    @Override
    public boolean onShowFileChooser(WebView webView, final ValueCallback<Uri[]> filePathsCallback, final WebChromeClient.FileChooserParams fileChooserParams) {
        Intent intent = fileChooserParams.createIntent();
        // FIX HERE (same as the above handler) vvvvvvvvvvvvvv @@
        intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE); 
        intent.setType(""*/*"");
        // FIX HERE ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ @@
```

### What is expected to happen?
The user should be prompted to choose which app to use to pick a file to upload


### What does actually happen?
On click no file picker is shown

## Information
These logs get generated when the upload button that should open the file picker is clicked:

""No activity found to handle file chooser intent.: android.content.ActivityNotFoundException: No Activity found to handle Intent { act=android.intent.action.GET_CONTENT cat= [android.intent.category.OPENABLE] typ=.jpg,.png,.tiff,.jpeg,.tif,.pdf }""

### Command or Code
Unfortunately I cannot share the code.

### Environment, Platform, Device
Android app built with Cordova.

Same result using the default WebView and the WebView provided by cordova-plugin-ionic-webview.

### Version information
Same result on cordova-android 7 and 8.

Unable to add platform for the plugin which is created using plugman.
## Problem
I have created a plugin using below command and the plugin was created successfully.

plugman create --name <pluginName> --plugin_id <pluginID> --plugin_version <version> [--path <directory>] [--variable NAME=VALUE]

But when i try to add a platform with below command, it fails.

plugman platform add --platform_name ios

### What is expected to happen?

It should add platform details to plugin.xml file which is created from the previous step.

### What does actually happen?
I got error on Terminal saying
""(node:6361) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: platform: true not yet supported""

89Cordova 9 Does Not Remember PluginsDavid Watkinsdavidofwatkins03/28/19, 08:07:05 PM"# Bug Report

## Problem

Cordova 9 is not automatically installing plugins from `package.json` when I add a platform with `cordova platform add`. This used to work on Cordova 8. (See steps to reproduce below.)

### What is expected to happen?

Assuming a fresh environment (i.e., no `platforms` or `plugins` directories), Cordova 9 should install plugins from `package.json` when adding a platform.

### What does actually happen?

Cordova 9 adds platforms without any of the plugins listed in `package.json` installed.

## Further Information
<!-- Include all relevant information that might help understand and reproduce the problem -->

After running `cordova plugin add`, plugins are only added to `package.json`, not `config.xml`. If I manually add a plugin to `config.xml`, `cordova platform add` does include it in the platform, but because `cordova plugin add` only updates `package.json`, there's no expectation that plugins should be declared in `config.xml`.

### Command or Code
<!-- What command or code is needed to reproduce the problem? -->

I'm able to prove this by creating a fresh Cordova 9 project as follows:

```sh
# initialize a new Cordova project
npm i -g cordova@9
cordova create cordova-test
cd cordova-test

# start off with an empty platform
cordova platform add android

# install a plugin
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera

# show that it's installed
cordova plugin ls

# this succeeds and produces:
# cordova-plugin-camera 4.0.3 ""Camera""
# cordova-plugin-whitelist 1.3.3 ""Whitelist""

# clear out the platforms and plugins directories, which are not
# normally checked into version control
rm -rf platforms/ plugins/

# add the platform again
cordova platform add android

# cordova-plugin-camera will not be re-installed,
# even though it has been added to package.json
cordova plugin ls
```

**Description:**
OGX.JS is a JavaScript framework to rapidly create mobile (Android, iOS), desktop (Android ChromeOS) and web applications.
""Thanks @globules-io. Given the sheer volume of existing web JavaScript libraries and frameworks, I would favor a quick list of unique benefits, how it compares to some close alternatives, and how it compares to some well-known frameworks such as Angular/Vue/React. =||= @brodybits have you had time to check out the 47 pages of the wiki? I will try to compile a bullet point list. This was made especially for Webview with Cordova in mind, unlike Angular/React. Didn't think there was enough framework for Cordova... What a weird comment with all due respect. =||= - OGX.JS does not rely on any tech stack, it is highly portable and does not require any compiler
- OGX.JS has templating operations unlike other frameworks, with temporary properties and global var support and loop operations
- OGX.JS supports template-binding to object properties (render different objects within the same list)
- OGX.JS has all the components already built-in so you don't need to code as much as other frameworks to output a pro grade app
- OGX.JS data handling is NoSQL, inspired by MongoDB (via OGX.List or MongOGX) unlike SQL based solutions, including querying, sorting, filtering, and multi level grouping, writing, reading.
- OGX.JS allows binding between components to filter/sort/display
- OGX.JS can transform and render complex datasets via different components with one line, including data trees (transform simple array into data trees and render it with one line via different components)
- OGX.JS is scope based and can render different data depending on the user scope
- OGX.JS is mobile first and has a multitude of components supporting drag, swipe, swipe reveal, reorder, tap-hold-drag-drop
- OGX.JS supports simple popups, tabbed popups, windows, views and tabbed views
- OGX.JS supports multiple virtual apps within an app via a Threater or ""stage explorer""
- OGX.JS supports auto blur/focus on all components in/out of the screen
- OGX.JS handles loading, storing and routing via a single app.json config, including preloading fonts, sounds, images, html templates..
- OGX.JS is fully event based
- OGX.JS supports fields and form binding including restrictions, validation and population
- OGX.JS has built in geo operations to work with maps and geo data such as addresses
- OGX.JS has built in color tools
- OGX.JS is thoroughly tested on iOS, Android, including ChromeOS and works also perfectly for PWA's
- And all of the other good stuff a framework is expected to have (history management, locking, dynamic views, display objects and much more).
- You do not need any other tool/library to built complex apps unlike other frameworks that are ""programming frameworks"". This is a product framework and is the only one of its kind.





 =||= For your consideration

94Does not work with CygwinChris Brodybrodybits04/05/19, 12:54:30 AM"# Bug Report

## Problem

Cordova tooling does not seem to work with Cygwin as reported by @dball-adashi in apache/cordova-docs#960

### What is expected to happen?

Cordova CLI should be able to work with Cygwin

### What does actually happen?

Installation using Cordova CLI fails on Cygwin, as discussed in apache/cordova-docs#960.

95Android location permissions not being requested using Cordova 9ekrapfl08/21/19, 03:23:12 AM"# Bug Report

## Problem
I am trying out using Cordova 9, and most things seem to be working alright, but the geolocation plugin is not adding the appropriate `uses-permission` tags to the android manifest file.

Note: this works fine if I revert back `cordova-cli@8` and `cordova-android@7`

### What is expected to happen?
Adding `cordova-plugin-geolocation` should add the appropriate permissions to the manifest file and allow requesting location in the app.
```
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"" />
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"" />
```

### What does actually happen?
Adding `cordova-plugin-geolocation`does not add the appropriate permissions, and thus, my app is not able to request a GPS location.

### Environment, Platform, Device
Android (have not attempted iOS yet)

### Version information
I am using
```
""cordova-plugin-geolocation"": ""4.0.1""
""cordova-android"": ""^8.0.0""
""cordova"": ""^9.0.0""
""ionic"": ""4.12.0""

Note: duplicate of this issue, but I thought I would ask here, as it has had no response, and I am making an assumption on where the bug is located.
https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation/issues/147""Cordova 9 has been out for a little while now.  Has anyone else experienced this issue?  Do you think there is something else going on in my project that could be causing this?  Any assistance would be great, because we would really like to start taking full advantage of that wicked fast prepare speed with Cordova 9 :)

Thanks! =||= @dpogue Do you think that could be connected to the config munge changes too? =||= It's certainly possible... =||= Any traction on this?  I still have not heard if anyone else is experiencing anything like this, but it happens every time for me.  No location permissions are added for Android, which makes my app in particular a brick ‚òπÔ∏è  =||= Could you provide copy-pasteable shell commands to reproduce this issue? Or a MWE if it's more complex? That could increase the chance of someone confirming this. Sorry for having you wait. =||= Yeah, sorry I should have narrowed this down sooner.  Basically, I just started with a simple `cordova create`.
Here is the package.json I am using:
```
{
  ""main"": ""index.js"",
  ""dependencies"": {
    ""cordova"": ""^9.0.0"",
    ""cordova-android"": ""^8.0.0"",
    ""cordova-plugin-geolocation"": ""4.0.1""
  },
  ""cordova"": {
    ""plugins"": {
      ""cordova-plugin-geolocation"": {}
    },
    ""platforms"": [
      ""android""
    ]
  }
}
```

And here is the config.xml:
```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<widget id=""io.cordova.hellocordova"" version=""1.0.0"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"" xmlns:cdv=""http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0"">
    <name>HelloCordova</name>
    <description>Hello</description>
    <author email=""dev@cordova.apache.org"" href=""http://cordova.io"">hello</author>
    <content src=""index.html"" />
    <access origin=""*"" />
    <allow-intent href=""http://*/*"" />
    <allow-intent href=""https://*/*"" />
    <plugin name=""cordova-plugin-geolocation"" spec=""4.0.1"" />
    <platform name=""android"">
        <allow-intent href=""market:*"" />
        <!-- <config-file parent=""/*"" target=""AndroidManifest.xml"">
            <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.CAMERA"" />
        </config-file> -->
    </platform>
    <engine name=""android"" spec=""^7.1.4"" />
</widget>
```

If you leave that line commented out and run an `npx cordova prepare`, you will see that the generated `platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` will have the proper location permissions:
```
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"" />
<uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"" />
<uses-feature android:name=""android.hardware.location.gps"" />
```

If you uncomment the lines in the config.xml, however, and re-run your `npx cordova prepare`, it will remove those permissions.

It is worth noting that I do see the following warning on prepare:
```
Conflict found, edit-config changes from config.xml will overwrite plugin.xml changes
```
However, I have always seen that warning, so I thought nothing of it when upgrading to Cordova 9.  Using Cordova 8, I saw that warning, but it still had all of the permissions in the AndroidManifest file.  It may very well be that I should be requesting camera permission in a different way than what I am attempting to do here, because it is clearly not allowing both the way I am specifying and the way the plugin wants to use.  What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
Eben =||= Seems to me that sometimes, plugins specify permissions, but sometimes they don't.  I can specify them with a `<config-file>`, but doing so should not overwrite the permissions specified by plugins I have added, right? =||= > Seems to me that sometimes, plugins specify permissions, but sometimes they don't. I can specify them with a `<config-file>`, but doing so should not overwrite the permissions specified by plugins I have added, right?

Agreed. I'll try to see if I can reproduce your issue. But from first glance, it does _not_ look like it's your fault. =||= This sounds exactly like https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/issues/389 and https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/issues/704 =||= @ekrapfl I can reproduce the issue. @dpogue Thanks for linking these issues. Would be great if @knight9999 could look into this. I actually have zero knowledge of the whole `ConfigChanges` code in `cordova-common`. =||= After upgrading to **Cordova 9.0.0 & Cordova-Android 8.0.0** I also reproducibly experienced a similar problem were the otherwise correctly generated Android Manifest file under **platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** was corrupted during **'cordova prepare'** phase. The actual changes (manifest ""corruption"") consisted in removing several **uses-permission** and **uses-features** tags from the initially correct manifest:
```xml 
    <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.INTERNET"" />
    <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES"" />
    <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"" />
    <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"" />
    <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.CAMERA"" />
    <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.FLASHLIGHT"" />
    <uses-feature android:name=""android.hardware.camera"" android:required=""true"" />
```
After digging a lot to find a solution to avoid this annoying behavior, I ended up with a final work-around where I used a Cordova hook for **before_prepare** & **after_prepare** that will backup & restore the correct manifest. 

Until an official fix/update will be provided, here is the hook that I've implemented, hoping to be useful for others encountering this bug. 
Please note the hook (to be removed when the bug is fixed!) is implemented into a single JavaScript file (**hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js**) covering both events being registered under **config.xml** as follows:

```xml
<hook type=""before_prepare"" src=""hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js""/>
<hook type=""after_prepare"" src=""hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js""/>
```

Below I included the relevant **hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js** JavaScript code that will backup & restore the manifest where the new created files (**AndroidManifest.xml.good** + **AndroidManifest.xml.bad**) are saved directly under **app** root folder (outside the **src** path) to avoid being included into Android app build processing.

```java
""use strict"";

/* eslint-env node */
var fs = require(""fs""),
	utils = require(""./utils""),
	colors = utils.colors,
	log = utils.log;

// hook function
function hook(context) {
	var manifestPath = ""./platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"",
		manifestPathGood = ""./platforms/android/app/AndroidManifest.xml.good"",
		read = function(file) {
			return fs.readFileSync(file, ""utf8"");
		},
		write = function(file, str) {
			return fs.writeFileSync(file, str, ""utf8"");
		},
		copy = function(source, dest) {
			write(dest, read(source));
		};
	if (context.hook === ""before_prepare"") {
		// backup the manifest
		log(""Backup 'AndroidManifest.xml' as "" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));
		copy(manifestPath, manifestPathGood);
	} else if (context.hook === ""after_prepare"") {
		var manifestText = read(manifestPath),
			manifestTextGood = read(manifestPathGood),
			manifestPathBad = ""./platforms/android/app/AndroidManifest.xml.bad"";
		// check if the the manifest was changed during preparation
		if (manifestText !== manifestTextGood) {
			log(""Save corrupted 'AndroidManifest.xml' under "" +	colors.yellow(manifestPathBad));
			write(manifestPathBad, manifestText);
			log(""Restore 'AndroidManifest.xml' from "" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));
			write(manifestPath, manifestTextGood);
		} else {
			log(""The AndroidManifest.xml is not modified during prepare "" + colors.red("" -> The 'android_manifest_fixer' hook is NOT needed anymore !""));
		}
	}
}

// export hook function
module.exports = hook;
```

The `utils` module includes some project dependent functions but you can safely remove/neglect them (colors + log exported functions) or just replace the full imports with:
```javascript
var fs = require(""fs""),
	colors = require(""chalk""),
	log = console.log;
``` 

With this small code change, hopefully the provided work-around will üöÄ for you as well üëç

Did you've properly registered the hook under config.xml ? Check this link ( https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/9.x/guide/appdev/hooks/#configxml )  for additional info on how to use the Cordova hooks.

If you are running `cordova prepare|build android --verbose` ( see: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/9.x/reference/cordova-cli/index.html#project-command-list ) you should see more info related to hook executions and if everything works fine you should also find the 2 generated files **(AndroidManifest.xml.good + AndroidManifest.xml.bad)** are saved directly under **platforms/android/app** folder =||= Yes, I added the hook, and it was running.  It was erroring out if I do not have an existing AndroidManifest.xml (ie: first time prepare).  It did not error out when I ran a `cordova platform add android` instead of the prepare (just trying to hit it from a different angle), but in that case, it gave me an AndroidManifest.xml that had even more stripped out of it.  I saw that it generated the `.good` and `.bad`, but neither of them was the one that I would have expected.  The `.bad` was the one that I have previously been getting from `cordova prepare` (makes sense), but the `.good` was an even more stripped down version.  It had less than what the previous one did. =||= >

@ekrapfl Sorry to hear that my workaround doesn't work for you üòü 
Since the prepare hooks are also triggered whenever the cordova project is created or a platform will be added to make sure the fixer backup/restore ones are executed just after `cordova build` is started, I've added a another hook (`before_build`) that will just set a flag `inBuildPhase` (otherwise false) that can be used as a guard for this special condition. See the snippets below:

**config.xml** updates:

```xml
<hook type=""before_build"" src=""hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js""/>
<hook type=""before_prepare"" src=""hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js""/>
<hook type=""after_prepare"" src=""hooks/android_manifest_fixer.js""/> 
```
**android_manifest_fixer.js** updates:

```javascript
""use strict"";

/* eslint-env node */
var fs = require(""fs""),
	colors = require(""chalk""),
	log = console.log,
	inBuildPhase = false; 

// hook function
function hook(context) {
	var manifestPath = ""./platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"",
		manifestPathGood = ""./platforms/android/app/AndroidManifest.xml.good"",
		read = function(file) {
			return fs.readFileSync(file, ""utf8"");
		},
		write = function(file, str) {
			return fs.writeFileSync(file, str, ""utf8"");
		},
		copy = function(source, dest) {
			write(dest, read(source));
		};
	if (!inBuildPhase) { // enable the fixed just in build 
	 	if  (context.hook === ""before_build"") {
			// flag the build phase
			log(""Enter build phase, enable the fixer!"");
			inBuildPhase = true
	 	}
	} else if (context.hook === ""before_prepare"") {
		// backup the manifest
		log(""Backup 'AndroidManifest.xml' as "" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));
		copy(manifestPath, manifestPathGood);
	} else if (context.hook === ""after_prepare"") {
		var manifestText = read(manifestPath),
			manifestTextGood = read(manifestPathGood),
			manifestPathBad = ""./platforms/android/app/AndroidManifest.xml.bad"";
		// check if the the manifest was changed during preparation
		if (manifestText !== manifestTextGood) {
			log(""Save corrupted 'AndroidManifest.xml' under "" +	colors.yellow(manifestPathBad));
			write(manifestPathBad, manifestText);
			log(""Restore 'AndroidManifest.xml' from "" + colors.yellow(manifestPathGood));
			write(manifestPath, manifestTextGood);
		} else {
			log(""The AndroidManifest.xml is not modified during prepare "" + colors.red("" -> The 'android_manifest_fixer' hook is NOT needed anymore !""));
		}
	}
}

// export hook function
module.exports = hook;
```

As the manifest corruption is happening just during pre-build prepare , I hope this enhanced handling will better isolate the problem and preserve the proper manifest.

 =||= Okay, so using your new script, if I start completely fresh (nuke node_modules, platforms, and plugins), do an `npm install`, and then run `cordova prepare`, then `cordova build android`, I end up with no difference from what I had before adding the hook.  Still missing some of the permissions.

Again, I don't necessarily need the workaround for now, I am just hoping for a fix.  Any news on that front @knight9999 or @raphinesse? =||= @raphinesse is there any update to share on this?  I know some other issues were mentioned as potentially related.  Unfortunately, this is still completely blocking us from using Cordova 9 and its amazingly fast prepare speeds :( =||= Unfortunately there is no progress on this that I know of. I understand that this is a serious problem. Incidentally, a personal friend just told me that he's affected by it too. As I stated above, unfortunately I myself am not acquainted with the code responsible for the config changes. Neither do I have time to dive into it right now.

It has been suggested that the bug might be caused by https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/24. So if you should want to take action yourself, you could go ahead and try if reverting that change fixes the bug for you. =||= @raphinesse Is there anyone else who could be poked to look into it?  I know dpogue said he has no time for Cordova at the moment, and you are unfamiliar with the area.  I have reached out to the original author of the PR in question, and he has not responded.  I would love to be able to help on this, but I have looked over the code from that PR, and I am completely clueless on what I would do to fix it.  I apologize for being so persistent on this issue, but as you said, it is a serious problem, so I want to make sure I am exhausting all of my options to get it resolved.

Thanks again! =||= @erisu can you free up something for this? If the aforementioned PR is really the culprit, would it be feasible to revert it? Better to have broken uninstalls than installs IMHO.

@ekrapfl can you verify that it works when using the latest version of cordova-common with the changes from the PR reverted? =||= I can give that a shot next week and let you know if it works for me. =||= @raphinesse Thanks you for responding the issue.
And sorry. As all you mentioned, there are some problems.

Basically, my PR https://github.com/apache/cordova-common/pull/24 is aiming to correct counting
in the munge section in platform.json.

This does not permit the conflicting of config-file/edit-config strictly.
When conflicting happens between config.xml and plugin.xml, the config.xml has priority and used.
Even if the conflicting is solvable.

As a result, the user must describe all permissions in config.xml if the user want to use additional permission which conflict to plugin.xml.

For example,
```
<config-file parent=""/*"" target=""AndroidManifest.xml"">
            <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.CAMERA"" />
            <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"" />
            <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"" /> 
            <uses-feature android:name=""android.hardware.location.gps"" />
</config-file>
```
 
 =||= @raphinesse I can confirm that reverting that PR does fix the issue for me.
@knight9999 I suppose a valid work around for the time being could be to take on the config-file additions from our plugins, but that doesn't seem like a permanent solution.  If plugins specify their own config dependencies, why should I have to duplicate what they have already said they need?

Thanks! =||= @ekrapfl  Thank a lot for the reporting your result.
Yes, I agree your opinion.

But anyway, the current situation in cordova config.xml/plugin.xml system is very complicated.

Because users can always edit their config.xml and add/remove plugins in any order.
Some config.xml/plugin.xml may conflict each other.
One more difficulty is how to recover the setting files when the plugin is removed if it was merged in complicated way.
The other difficulty is how to distinguish which settings are already applied, which settings are not yet applied and then which settings are merged in what way when the users edit his config.xml.

I think the `munge` system builtin cordova is a good system to resolve them, but it may be not enough.

I image that the bi-directional system (add <-> remove,  edit <-> recover, merge <-> unmerge are possible) is too difficult.
I think that the one-way system (it always generates settings files from the original files by applying each patch) is more simple even if there is still conflict problem.

The problem here is that cordova@9 generates a wrong manifest even while removing/adding platform from scratch.

I have managed to use the workaround suggested (btw, thank you very much @cyparu) by downgrading cordova to version 8, removing android platform, adding it again (AndroidManifest.xml is correct on this point), uninstalling cordova 8, installing cordova 9.

BTW, facing this issue on several projects. Not only for third party plugins, but for own edit-config tags. I cannot use my own network_security_config, which used to work on cordova 8 (this edit-config is default on ionic):
```
<edit-config file=""app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"" mode=""merge"" target=""/manifest/application"" xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
    <application android:networkSecurityConfig=""@xml/network_security_config"" />
</edit-config>
<resource-file src=""resources/android/xml/network_security_config.xml"" target=""app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml"" />
``` =||= @gartorware Thanks for the detailed report. Does your issue still exist?

I have tried your `config.xml`
```
        <edit-config file=""app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"" mode=""merge"" target=""/manifest/application"" xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"">
            <application android:networkSecurityConfig=""@xml/network_security_config"" />
        </edit-config>
        <resource-file src=""resources/android/xml/network_security_config.xml"" target=""app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml"" />
```
without any plugin.

In Cordova 8.1 (cordova-android 7.1.4) project, the AndroidManifest.xml leads
```
    <application android:hardwareAccelerated=""true"" android:icon=""@mipmap/icon"" android:label=""@string/app_name"" android:networkSecurityConfig=""@xml/network_security_config"" android:supportsRtl=""true"">
```

In Cordova 9.0 (cordova-android 8.0.0) project, the AndroidManifest.xml leads
```
    <application android:hardwareAccelerated=""true"" android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher"" android:label=""@string/app_name"" android:networkSecurityConfig=""@xml/network_security_config"" android:supportsRtl=""true"">
```
The results are same.

Please remove `node_modules`, `package-lock.json` when you removing android platform, adding it again  =||= Yeah, without any plugins it may work. But when some plugin add their own `edit-config` or `config-file` cordova mess up the final AndroidManifest.xml. Even if those `edit-config` are not related to each other still issues arises.

Lately, I'm facing issues even with cordova-8 now. I have a plugin which add tons of new lines to AndroidManifest.xml by using config-file. Then this xml-security edit-config mess it up, dropping sequential lines from resulting AndroidManifest.xml on each build. I mean, it drops a (random?) line when I build, lets say L50. I restore that dropped line, then on next build it drops L51. =||= @gartorware Thanks. I think the typical situation in which i can reproduce this issue is following.
```
$ cordova create sampleProject
$ cd sampleProject
$ cordova platform add android
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera
```
Then we found the `platforms/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml ` as
```
<!-- list1 -->
    <application android:hardwareAccelerated=""true"" android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher"" android:label=""@string/app_name"" android:supportsRtl=""true"">
        <activity android:configChanges=""orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale"" android:label=""@string/activity_name"" android:launchMode=""singleTop"" android:name=""MainActivity"" android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.DeviceDefault.NoActionBar"" android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustResize"">
            <intent-filter android:label=""@string/launcher_name"">
                <action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" />
                <category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        <provider android:authorities=""${applicationId}.provider"" android:exported=""false"" android:grantUriPermissions=""true"" android:name=""org.apache.cordova.camera.FileProvider"">
            <meta-data android:name=""android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"" android:resource=""@xml/camera_provider_paths"" />
        </provider>
    </application>
```
where the `provider` directive is added by camera plugin.

Then I edit config.xml to add
```
<!-- list2 -->
        <edit-config file=""AndroidManifest.xml"" target=""/manifest/application"" mode=""merge"">
            <application android:usesCleartextTraffic=""true"" />
        </edit-config>
```
in `<platform name=""android"">` directive. Then do `cordova prepare` again.

We expect this to add `android:usesCleartextTraffic=""true""` attribute in `application` directive.

However, the resulting `AndroidManifest.xml` is
```
<!-- list3 -->
    <application android:hardwareAccelerated=""true"" android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher"" android:label=""@string/app_name"" android:supportsRtl=""true"" android:usesCleartextTraffic=""true"">
        <activity android:configChanges=""orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale"" android:label=""@string/activity_name"" android:launchMode=""singleTop"" android:name=""MainActivity"" android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.DeviceDefault.NoActionBar"" android:windowSoftInputMode=""adjustResize"">
            <intent-filter android:label=""@string/launcher_name"">
                <action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" />
                <category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
```
We found
1) The `android:usesCleartextTraffic=""true""` attribute in `application` directive is added as we expect.
2) The `provider` directive in `application` disappears. This is contrary to expectations. =||= This happens because both `edit-config` in `config.xml` and  `config-file` in `plugin.xml` are going to update the same `application` directive in `AndroidManifest.xml` and then they conflict. 
The logic in `cordova-common` can not resolve this conflict and apply the only one which takes high priority. In this case, `edit-config` in `config.xml` takes high priority.

To resolve this issue,  we must introduce the logic to resolve this kind of conflict programatically. =||= If we resolved conflict, there is another difficulty.
1) If we remove `edit-config` directive in `config.xml`, the `AndroidManifext.xml` should be back to the previous one. 
2) If we remove `camera` plugin, the `AndroidManifest.xml` should become to the one in which only `edit-config` in `config.xml` is applied.

99Please add Application Preferences as a core pluginSteve Johnsonsvenyonson08/14/19, 04:10:07 PM"# Feature Request

## Motivation Behind Feature
Just about any mobile application can benefit from a native preferences pane. There is such a plugin currently: `https://github.com/apla/me.apla.cordova.app-preferences`

Unfortunately, the repo appears to be abandoned with no support. It does not work using the latest platforms/frameworks. (xcode 10, cordova 8.0)

This really needs to be a CORE plugin, so that this functionality will always be available.


## Feature Description

The plugin will allow users to specify the application preference definitions in JSON. (these ultimately wind up in the native settings.bundle). Then, the plugin allows the application to read/write values from preferences. When accessing preferences through the system interface (eg. ios ->Settings -> Application), the accessed settings reflect whatever changes were made from the application.




## Alternatives or Workarounds

Unfortunately, with the existing plugin broken, there is none. Dead in the water


"I think that all Cordova maintainers (including myself) are already overloaded without having to maintain an Application Preferences plugin. I would favor that someone or some people who are so motivated pick up the work and continue with a new plugin name.

100No native Web Assembly (wasm) support detected in Cordova appflavioflavioeverardo05/08/19, 06:07:20 AM"# Bug Report

## Problem

Cordova is running my application normally when the target is a browser but no native wasm support is detected when the target is iOS. Despite currently this is an iOS bug/problem, I'm reporting this here because I expect to further deploy the application to Android hoping that the same solution fits both.

### What is expected to happen?
You can try the application hosted on my server http://www.flavioeverardo.com/clingo/ where with a simple click on the run button, the Answer Set Programming (ASP) solver 'clingo' (which was compiled into wasm) solves the given problem.

A normal output would be something like this:
```
clingo version 5.3.1
Reading from stdin
Solving...
Answer: 1
motive(harry) motive(sally) guilty(harry) innocent(sally)
SATISFIABLE

Models       : 1
Calls        : 1
Time         : 0.001s (Solving: 0.00s 1st Model: 0.00s Unsat: 0.00s)
CPU Time     : 0.000s
```

As mentioned before, running the same files locally when targeting the browser in cordova, gives a similar output as the one shown above. Everything works fine on browsers like Firefox, Chrome or Safari. You can also run the application from the link above in your phone browsers normally.

### What does actually happen?

When targeting into iOS (and I guess the same happens with Android but I have not tried it yet), the run button is disabled because all the dependencies are not fully loaded. The message shown is:
```
no native wasm support detected
```
I have tried it in the simulator running an iPhone 6s as well as in my iPhone (which is also an iPhone 6s) running iOS 12.2. I tried different simulators and deployment targets from 9.3 to 12.1 without success including physical devices.

## Information
<!-- Include all relevant information that might help understand and reproduce the problem -->

Thanks again. =||= > How can I know that indeed my cordova app is running WKWebView instead of UIWebView?

You should see something along this line in the Xcode log when you launch your app from there:

`2019-04-26 14:07:20.150249+0200 HelloCordova[9191:393930] Using WKWebView`

> Should I use the ionic WebView? ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-webview

You can try both, the Ionic WebView is just a fork and renaming of the cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine

---

My quick test showed that WASM support is not working in a Simulator either (using the regular Safari app) **but is working fine** on my iPhone XS with iOS 12.3 beta with the cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine!
(I've tested your linked demo and https://webassembly.org/demo/) =||= Hi @timbru31 thanks again for your help.
Now I'm sure that my app is running WKWebView as shown in the Xcode console.
Initially, I had created the project, add the platforms and then add the plugin (with the additional lines in the config.xml). 
That threw some errors that the Info.plist file was missing and UIWebView was the default view shown in the Xcode console.
To correct this I had to remove the ios platform:
```cordova platform remove ios```
and afterwards add it again with the ```--save``` flag:
```cordova platform add ios --save```

Now the WKWebView is set as the default view. As you said, I had no luck to see the app working with the simulators. 
On the other hand, I'm glad that you tried a couple of options and they work with a device. Unfortunately, I don't have access to devices supporting iOS 12+. 
I will ask someone to test the app or ask someone to lend me a device to test it so we can close the issue.

Regards,
Flavio =||= Awesome! I might find enough time tomorrow to test an iPad with iOS 11, too. =||= Hi @timbru31 have you got a chance to test it on iOS 11? 
I can share that fortunately I have the chance to recompile the binary to a asm.js instead of a wasm file. I have tested it with a UIWebView and it works. I imagine that it will work on WKWebView too. 
I also ran it into my old iPad (iOS 9.3) and works too. 
I have not tried it yet on devices with iOS 11 or 12+ but I hope to do it soon. =||= I've tested:

103[Plugins] Typings Versioning, Maintenance and DocumentationJan Piotrowskijanpio07/03/19, 12:47:47 PM"Most of our plugins now have a `types` folder where we have typing for Typescript:

https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar/tree/master/types
https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar/blob/master/types/index.d.ts

This is useful, especially in the context of Ionic and Angular. @timbru31 is our typings expert, and takes on the role of keeping those up to date and is their ""owner"" more or less. here is an issue tracking that work: https://github.com/apache/cordova/issues/39

But I have some questions regarding Versioning, Maintenance and Documentation:

1.

- In https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar/pull/132 the question came up of including the plugin version number in the typings themselves. Do we actually need to do that, when we host the typings ourselves? Updating those version numbers would add an extra step to the release process (and surely be forgotten from time to time). So if they are not _needed_ for our self hosted typings, I would rather leave them out.

2. Also:

- Are there tools to create these typings automatically?
- Are there tools to check if the typings are current and valid somehow?

3. We need some documentation that is more than ""ask @timbru31"" so that we can properly support those typings as part of our core plugins, and maybe even give guidance to plugin authors why and how to include them in theirs. Should this live in the general plugin documentation in our main docs?""> * In [apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar#132](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar/pull/132) the question came up of including the plugin version number in the typings themselves.
> [...]

I would personally downvote that idea. I think that dependent code should be able to code to the interface without regard to what version of the plugin it is using.

> * Are there tools to create these typings automatically?

If the source code is JSDoc annotated, I have seen some tools that will generate the `.d.ts`:

- https://github.com/englercj/tsd-jsdoc
- https://github.com/otris/jsdoc-tsd
- https://github.com/fivetran/typescript-closure-tools (Closure being a style of JSDoc)

I would generally favor using JSDoc with types for the multiple benefits of maintainability, clarity, and [Type Safe JavaScript with JSDoc](https://medium.com/@trukrs/type-safe-javascript-with-jsdoc-7a2a63209b76) (article by @rbiggs). =||= > I think that dependent code should be able to code to the interface without regard to what version of the plugin it is using.

My formulation might not have been clear enough: The version number is only included in a comment at the beginning of the file, to indicate which version the definitions apply to. There is nothing blocking the use of the definitions with mismatched version number or anything.

Disadvantage is that this creates a new mandatory release step because that number of course has to be incremented with each release. =||= Well, I agree that such a comment should not exist since naturally the typings in the plugin package apply to the version of the plugin that is in the package which is the version of the package. Easy :) =||= For definitions hosted on DefinitelyTyped it makes sense to add a version number, because there is a loose coupling with the code. You can update those packages independently. 

In the situation where the definitions are part of the code repo/packages it does not make sense to add a version number, as there is a hard link with the version of the code in that same package.

So in the Cordova case I would go for not having a version number in there. =||= Just went through all our plugins with types and removed the plugin version numbers.

## Information
<!-- Include all relevant information that might help understand and reproduce the problem -->
Steps to reproduce:

1. Create new cordova project
2. Test it on UIWebView - It's working
3. Test it on WKWebView - not working

### Command or Code

```
cordova create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld
cordova platform add ios
```
Open project in Xcode and change **receivedEvent**: function from index.html file accordingly
(Just adding simple DFP add - js api)
```
receivedEvent: function(id) {
                googletag.cmd.push(function() {
			googletag.defineSlot('/271507443/patuljak-aplikacija-b2', 
			[300, 250],
			'here').addService(googletag.pubads()).setCollapseEmptyDiv(true);
			
			googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest();
			googletag.enableServices();
			googletag.display('here');
		});
}
```
create empty div in body of index.html file
```
<div id=""here""></div>
```

Add to head of index.html file

```
<script async='async' src='https://www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js'></script>
  <script>
  	var googletag = googletag || {};
  	googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || [];
  </script>
```

Run project in xcode... Everything **should be running fine in UIWebView.**

Now, add WKWebView plugin
```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine
```
After successful installation, you should have, inside config.xml file:
```
<feature name=""CDVWKWebViewEngine"">
        <param name=""ios-package"" value=""CDVWKWebViewEngine"" />
    </feature>
    <preference name=""CordovaWebViewEngine"" value=""CDVWKWebViewEngine"" /> 
```
Run project again, **it is not possible to click on add in WKWebView**

If wkwebview plugin removed everything works fine again.
Working OK in browser too.

116Cordova app unable to access external scripts on AndroidCarl Andrew Lemalemacarl06/01/19, 07:52:58 AM"# Bug Report

## Problem

### What is expected to happen?

Cordava app on Android should be able to access external scripts


### What does actually happen?

When I run the app on Android I get a `Refused to load script error...` in the console log. I am using Chrome Developer Tools to debug the WebView

## Information
I have installed `cordova-plugin-whitelist` and added `<access origin=""*"" />` to the `config.xml`. When I run the app in the browser I don't get any error and all the external scripts are loaded.

The error message that I get is:
```
Refused to load the script 'file://www.radiojar.com/wrappers/api-plugins/v1/player.js?1.65.1t' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: ""script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' http://www.radiojar.com/wrappers/api-plugins/v1/player.js http://www.radiojar.com/wrappers/api-plugins/v1/jplayer/jplayer.js http://now-dot-playing-dot-radiojarcom.appspot.com/api/stations/u31u2awpxbwtv/now_playing/"". Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.

120Run background jobsDario Salvidariosalvi7805/03/21, 02:32:01 PM"# Feature Request

## Motivation Behind Feature
Currently, there is no way to schedule code execution in the background in Cordova apps.
Android supports this through [jobs](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidTaskScheduling/article.html) and iOS [is going to support this functionality too](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks) soon.
In browsers, one could use service workers (which are not available in Webviews) and in desktops, one could use other native systems ([Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page) and [MacOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html))

## Feature Description
The feature would allow to schedule future execution of JS code, in background, while having access to global variables and plugins, like it was running on the webview, but without access to the DOM.
An example of the code could be:

```js
cordova.backgroundSchedule({
  requiresNetwork: true,
  requiresExternalPower: false,
  when: new Date() // some time in the future
  }, function () {
  // my code here has access to the plugins
})
```



## Alternatives or Workarounds
I don't know if this idea would fit better as a new plugin or as a platform-wise feature.

Running JS code in iOS outside of the Webview is possible through the [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore), while in Android, there are [a bunch of alternatives](https://medium.com/tech-quizlet/comparison-shopping-searching-for-javascript-engines-for-android-bdc656538f2e).
Same applies for Desktop ([Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5742128/javascript-standalone-compiler-or-interpreter-for-windows) and [MacOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore)).

Currently, the only way to execute background code is through [this plugin](https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-background-mode), but it comes with limitations (e.g. execution cannot be scheduled).""This definitely is a candidate for a plugin (as it is only needed by some users, also a new API that will probably need some iteration) - but a very interesting one. =||= it looks like [this](https://github.com/transistorsoft/cordova-plugin-background-fetch) plugin implements what I requested.
I haven't tried it yet though. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0
122Loading chunk 0 failedManjucloudmpower11/26/19, 05:44:44 PM"# Bug Report
The cordova app often fails to load the webview saying Loading chunk x failed.
It happens very rarely though. Not sure if it is related to cordova or webpack. 
This bug is random in nature and cant be reproducible.

Most of the users have been facing this issue and yet there is no working solution.

### What is the expected behaviour
Chunks should be loaded without error as all the chunks are present. 

### Environment, Platform, Device
<!-- In what environment, on what platform or on which device are you experiencing the issue? -->
Cordova any version
Both android and ios
Webpack: 4

123[Plugins] Convert to eslintJan Piotrowskijanpio08/05/20, 12:01:37 AM"Some plugins are still using jshint or no linting at all. Those should be converted to use eslint as most Cordova core plugins already do.

To convert:

129Can't build anymore on Cordova after activating iOS app group and service notification extensionjay34fr11/26/19, 05:42:24 PM"Hi all,

I have a mobile application under : 
- Cordova 8.1.2. 
- iOS platform 5.0.0 
- onesignal-cordova-plugin 2.4.7 
- Xcode 10.2.1

Everything was ok. Building &co.

Then I tried to activate the iOS Service notification extension in order to have Media Attachments.

I followed these docs from OneSignal (in this order) : 
- https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ios-sdk-setup#section-1-add-notification-service-extension-recommend- 
- https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/ios-sdk-app-groups-setup

Everything was ok. I was able to launch the app from Xcode and the Media attachments tests were OK.

But then I try to build again my app in CLI and I have the issue : 
CordovaError: Could not find *-Info.plist file, or config.xml file.

I think Xcode changed some parameter but I can't figure what...

If you have any idea, it will be really appreciated.

Thx in advance for your help.""This looks like an issue with the OneSignal SDK plugin, wonder if you should [raise an issue there](https://github.com/onesignal/OneSignal-Cordova-SDK/issues).

In case you think this is an issue with Cordova, a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) would really be appreciated (see [this guide](https://github.com/apache/cordova-contribute/blob/master/create-reproduction.md) for more details).

We would also highly recommend you upgrade to Cordova CLI version 9 as we do not support old versions. =||= @jay34fr have you found a way to fix it ?
Have you also found a way to set up onesignal with only Cordova settings ?

Thank you. =||= It looks like you may not have the `HOME` env variable defined. =||= We already set PATH env variable, can you please let us know what we need to set in HOME env variable. =||= `HOME` should be a path to your User's home directory that has the `.cordova` folder inside. =||= We are using Centos 7 and don't have that directory.  I have searched for it but there is no directory. =||= Anyway, from your given information the problem is that you don't have a `HOME` path defined.

It fails in the following [statement in cordova-lib](https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/blob/dfbab745d918de1cb24b2b0fe6bd1652ac2b227b/src/cordova/util.js#L29-L32).

What you could do, is to define a path, which can be accessed by the user that executes the command (it expects you have a `.cordova` folder with a `lib` folder inside, but should work without it too).

 =||= Looks like a bug to me then, if Cordova requires a `HOME` env var that might not be set on all environments. =||= > Looks like a bug to me then, if Cordova requires a `HOME` env var that might not be set on all environments.

For Windows, we require `USERPROFILE` variable and for Unix/Linux environments - `HOME`. `HOME` env variable indicates the home directory of the current user and is the default argument for the `cd` built-in command. So I wouldn't necessarily say it's a bug.  =||= We found the solution, some how after update nodeJs and cordova env variables are not working, only worked in cmd terminal, so need to add env variable in server script page, in my case i add putenv(""CORDOVA_HOME=/usr/bin/cordova""); to find cordova location run 'which cordova' in cmd terminal it will give the cordova install location, after that can easily get all cordova cmd in server scripting(exec('cordova -v')).

132Cordova lazy loading support for angular 8.Amanrajsingh7107/01/19, 02:43:49 PM"# Cordova lazy loading support for angular 8 application

## Motivation Behind Feature: 

We are using cordova for mibile hybrid applications. It was working fine with earlier deployed version but after we implemented lazy loading to optimize script bundle, the apps start and shows splash screen but does not proceed further and shows white screen indefinitely. Not sure whether a new feature or we are missing some thing

""Have you remote debugged your app to look at the console for errors? https://ionic.zone/debug/remote-debug-your-app =||= We are using Angular 8 framework and use cordova to build the .apk. We have not used ionic framework.
We have debugged the application in android simulator and real device. In android simulator we got  error ""to much work done by thread and skipped frame 30"".
 =||= The instructions on that domain apply to all Cordova apps. Please read them and remote debug the webview of the Andorid app to find out why the screen is white. =||= Hi,
Thanks for the information. I was able to debug and below are the error thrown in console:

> Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of """". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
polyfills-es2015.c1d076c765b5a6049f69.js:1 
Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of """". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
main-es2015.2a7d1e25ee26f4704128.js:1 
Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of """". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.

Please let me know if any other information is required.

Thanks.
 =||= Is this the cause for the web app crashing and showing a white screen? Does it stop the loading of the scripts in the network panel? Do you get any other errors in the console panel? =||= Hi,

Thanks for the guidance.

The issue was caused due to differential loading in Angular 8 due to which the dynamically generated .js files were not loading due to file type not recognized. The issue has been fixed by adding TYPE of file Manually.

Best Regards. =||= Awesome, great that I could point you into the correct direction.

Could you maybe share some code that helped to solve your problem? Maybe other people will find this issue via Google and be thankful for instructions.

Is this something we should bring up with Angular to better support somehow? =||= Hi,
 We have fixed the issue by adding ""type=text/javascript"" in index.html after creation of .dist file.

Because of angular differential loading runtime.js, polyfill.js gets added to indexl.html file and they have a TYPE=MODULE but ""type=text/javascript"" is not there (it would be helpful if it is included) hence web browser dose not have any issue identifying the MIME type but if we built an apk or ipa using the same .dist through cordova then Android native is not able to identify the MIME type hence the error is thrown.

Thanks. =||= Oh that is very interesting!

Can you point me to some documentation about this ""differential loading"" in Angular 8? (I know very little about Angular, so I would be interested in learning a bit more to udnerstand how exactly this works.) Maybe we can create a PR for Angular to fix this permanently. =||= > Oh that is very interesting!

Here you go:
https://auth0.com/blog/angular-8-differential-loading/ (Angular specific)
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#attr-script-nomodule (HTML spec) =||= Hmm, that probably means this should better be implemented on the webview or Cordova side, as Angular is doing exactly what is expected. Correct? =||= I assume yes. But I haven't made any tests so far (sadly this issue doesn't include any version information, too) =||= @Amanrajsingh71 Can you help us to create a minimal Android app that reproduces this behavior (without the fix you did)? That would be awesome! =||= @janpio I have attached a minimal cordova app that reproduces the issue. I think it may be more of an issue with the Android WebView. But all default Angular8 apps will not work in Cordova without modifications.

 =||= @janpio Is this actually resolved? =||= Any ideas why this has been closed? =||= I spent 2 hours figuring this one out. I will post this here, maybe it will help someone else:

Basically, you can opt out of differential loading by configuring your Angular project directly as explained on the official doc:

https://angular.io/guide/deployment#opting-out-of-differential-loading

Your cordova / Angular 8 app should work correctly after that without the need to fiddle with the <script> in the index.html file =||= Try changing the tsconfig.json target from es2015 back down to es5, this disables differential loading. This solution worked for me. =||= > Is this actually resolved?
&mdash; @juristr

> Any ideas why this has been closed?
&mdash; @tscislo

The Android WebView used by Cordova loads files via `file://` URLs. However, [the MDN guide on modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#Other_differences_between_modules_and_standard_scripts) states that:
> You need to pay attention to local testing ‚Äî if you try to load the HTML file locally (i.e. with a `file://` URL), you'll run into CORS errors due to JavaScript module security requirements. You need to do your testing through a server.

You can also go ahead and try to open the minimal reproduction that @jamcoupe posted (thanks, by the way) directly from the file system with Chrome. It will give a `net::ERR_FAILED` when trying to load the script with `type=""module""`. Since the Android WebView is Chrome, there's little we can do about this issue.

That means, that configuring your build to not use `type=""module""` is the correct solution here. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

148"Cordova ""Apple will stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView"" warning when submitting to app store"Ryan Holtonsts-ryan-holton09/03/19, 01:37:35 PM"# Bug Report

## Problem

I'm building a hybrid app for both iOS and Android. The app primarily is built using [Nuxt JS](https://nuxtjs.org/), a Javascript based Vue JS framework, along with [Vuetify JS](https://v15.vuetifyjs.com/en/). I'm using Cordova 8.0.0 currently to build and compile my app and have recently submitted our first ever app to the app store for review, I have recieved back a depreciation warning and am concerned that this isn't going to be fixed in Cordova?

```
ITMS-90809: Deprecated API Usage - Apple will stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView APIs . See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwebview for more information.
```
I'm using very few Cordova plugins, and am wondering whether this issue has been addressed, or is related to one of my Cordova based plugins listed below.

### What is expected to happen?

The depreciation warning shouldn't appear when submitting to the app store from a Cordova project.


### What does actually happen?

The warning appears.



## Information
<!-- Include all relevant information that might help understand and reproduce the problem -->

NPM version: 6.10.2
Node version: 10.13.0
Xcode: 10.3

I'm building for iOS 12.4, with a deployment target of 10.0

I'm using the following Cordova plugins and their versions:

```json
""dependencies"": {
        ""cordova-android"": ""^7.1.4"",

Please advice on this issue.
your early response in this regard would be highly appreciated.
Thank you""See https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues/661

Long story short, there is no official solution yet. Some people have offered PRs to remove references of `UIWebView` which you can try at your own risk. Apple has given no official date of when they will actually start to reject apps still referencing `UIWebView`. At this current time, you can still submit and update apps using the `UIWebView`

However if you are using the `UIWebView`, which is the current default, then I'd recommend to start planning immediately to migrate to the [WkWebview](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine). `WKWebView` migration could be a breaking change for you that you should be prepared for.

Additionally the [cordova-ios](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues) repo is a better place to raise issues for the specific platform. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

163Sustainability of Cordova maintenanceChris Brodybrodybits12/22/19, 12:50:20 AM"I would like to flag this as a critical issue.

We have been adding one maintainer after another but continue to suffer from a lack of resources so badly needed to keep up with bug reports and the rapidly changing mobile platform APIs.

I think we need to have some sponsorship of the most important maintenance tasks including:

- timely updates to keep up with the mobile platform APIs
- bug fixes
- documentation
- community support
- modernization and cleanup of the existing JavaScript

I think the root cause is the loss of backing from a couple major companies.

We have discussed some ideas on the mailing list including:

- CodeFund.io
- [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) (unfortunately it tells me to join a wait list)
- Tidelift (I tried https://tidelift.com/lifter/search/npm/cordova-lib but it shows me a ""needs subscribers"" message)

We also discussed Bountysource but it does not seem to be right for project *sustainability*.

I think it would be ideal if some of the biggest corporate users would be willing to give something back to help us improve the sustainability.

Unfortunately the Apache Foundation ""sponsorship"" program does not seem prepared to support our needs on updates and bug fixes: http://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html#FundsGo

I do understand and respect that we would likely need to coordinate this kind of an effort with the Apache Foundation.

I think this is especially bad in comparison to competitive frameworks such as Capacitor and React Native which do seem to have stronger corporate backing.

While the original goal was to ""cease to exist"", I think lack of sustainability is not the way we want to reach this result.

I would also like to vote +1 to pin this issue in first place.

P.S. I am adding a disclaimer that my description and comments in this issue are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of any other Apache Cordova maintainers, Apache Cordova project members, Apache Cordova PMC members, Apache Cordova board members, or ASF (Apache Software Foundation).""First step: clarify the existing situation in the footer apache/cordova-docs#1020 =||= Amazon has recently launched an opensource sponsorship program:
https://aws.amazon.com/fr/blogs/opensource/aws-promotional-credits-open-source-projects/

They could provide free servers for e.g CI.
 =||= Historically, apache Cordova was owned by Adobe Inc.
Maybe they would be interested in helping their child?  =||= Correction: Apache Cordova was never owned by Adobe Inc.

Adobe Inc. acquired PhoneGap then donated the IPR to the Apache through an incubator project, with license changed from MIT to Apache 2.0.

My understanding is that Adobe is no longer interested in sponsoring time for maintenance.

Major competitor is now Ionic Capacitor, which is under the simplistic MIT license and does not require the app to wait for non-standardized ""deviceready"" event.

Major advantage of Cordova is very limited amount of JavaScript needed in the WebView. In contrast, Ionic Capacitor seems to come bundled with more JavaScript or TypeScript in its core.

In terms of servers, my understanding is that as an open-source project, it should be no problem for us to get the git, build, and testing servers we need for free. Developer time to keep up with bug fixes, platform updates, documentation, and GitHub support is badly needed. =||= @brodybits
While capacitor is arguably better than Cordova, it has not yet a great support of all 3000+ Cordova native plugins. =||= I think Capacitor took some major efforts to remain compatible with the most important Cordova plugins. If they missed any major plugins, I would be interested. =||= @brodybits I am not aware of any incompatibility, I just doubt they have reached full compatibility and would love to be proved otherwise.
Anyway this is off topic. =||= I am sure they would love a report if you find any major compatibility

Issue close rate and PR close rate definitely look good.

Maintainers have definitely been working quite hard to keep the issues and maintenance under control.

Unfortunately I have to say that I do see a few areas where we could still use some improvement, such as:

- Completely remove and replace all use of UIWebView on iOS
- cordova-windows@7.0.0 did not work for a number of people including myself due to an old issue with WinJS (see cordova-windows issue number 341, which I am *not* linking from here). Bug was fixed but never released for about half a year. I took time out of my own schedule to make the new cordova-windows release, which is unfortunately DOA due to issues with updating 
- I think there are many, many, many issues on cordova-docs that have been piling up over the months. I think it would be good if someone would have a chance to do a more thorough review of the documentation for both accuracy and clarity. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0
164Apple will stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView APIs praveen-angular10/14/19, 02:40:09 PM"HI Team,
We have a received a notification from apple Appstore for Cordova app deployment, saying ""Apple will stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView APIs . See https://developer.apple.com... for more information."" Is there any alternative available from Cordova to overcome this issue.

Got this warning messages which is going for upload in the current month""See https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues/661

Long story short, there is no official solution yet. Some people have offered PRs to remove references of `UIWebView` which you can try at your own risk. Apple has given no official date of when they will actually start to reject apps still referencing `UIWebView`. At this current time, you can still submit and update apps using the `UIWebView`

However if you are using the `UIWebView`, which is the current default, then I'd recommend to start planning immediately to migrate to the [WkWebview](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine). `WKWebView` migration could be a breaking change for you that you should be prepared for.

Additionally the [cordova-ios](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues) repo is a better place to raise issues for the specific platform. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0
165Cordova not allowing beta versions of plugins to run, instead requiring full version numbers.Matt Milanmattmilan-dev10/23/19, 10:37:14 PM"# Bug Report

## Problem

When running `cordova run ios --device --verbose --target <IPHONE_TARGET>` after updating to MacOS 10.15 Catalina, cordova now returns: 
```
CordovaError: Promise rejected with non-error: 'Version should contain only numbers and dots'
    at cli.catch.err (/Users/devleaf.matt/.npm-global/lib/node_modules/cordova/bin/cordova:30:15)
    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:68:7)
```
rather than going on to a successful IPA install and launch on my iPhone. After searching around it seems people have this problem with the google maps plugin, however I don't have this installed on my system. I have re-installed cordova, reinstalled cordova ios (platform removal and re-addition) and double checked my Cocoa pods version.

Does any of your packages or plugins you have installed have a version format other than `x.y.z` format? =||= Hi Breautek, thanks for your quick response. I'll post below my plugin list in the config.xml, however I believe the problem to be the `<plugin name=""cordova-plugin-local-notification"" spec=""^0.9.0-beta.3"" />` plugin. I'll downgrade to 0.9.0 but is it possible to keep this plugin in the current beta as some features between 0.9.0 and beta.3 are not available?

 =||= I'll mark this as a bug. I think cordova should support prerelease labels. They are perfectly valid in the [semver](https://semver.org/) spec.

Meanwhile, a workaround could be installing the plugin from the git repo, assuming it is hosted in a git repo. You can install the plugin from git. e.g;
`cordova plugin add https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-local-notifications.git#0.9-beta.3`

Installing plugins from git should bypass semver version checks. Of course you lose out on automatic updating on minor/patch updates. =||= Hi breautek,

So i've tried adding the local notification plugin using the git repo rather than the conventional `cordova add <plugin>@latest` and it when running `cordova plugin list` i noticed it was still pulling 0.9.0-beta3 as it's name, unfortunately meaning there isn't a way to add the plugin without forking and changing the version number. 

Quick edit: So i've forked the plugin and changed it's version number to 0.9.1 rather than 0.9.0-beta 3 but am still getting the error. Below is the `cordova plugin list` output.

Hi Raphinesse, 

I'm sorry it's not the best fix in the world, the semver spec is quite dynamic and has that many variants that it would take a while to process fully (unfortunately I don't have too much time on my hands) however this allows beta/alpha variants to work properly (or so it seems in my testing). Hope this helps someone in the future! =||= I have nothing with beta versions but I am getting the same error.

 =||= Hi adminy,

I noticed that a certain iOS plugin was running 1.10.0-beta3 even though no plugin I installed was of that version. To my knowledge (and I could be wrong), these plugins update near runtime in order to allow you to stay up to date so you won't know for sure. If you review my pull request above then modify that file in your local ios/osx setup then it will work as a temporary solution before I get the pull request submitted later today. =||= Thank you @devleaf-matt your pull request worked, except it wasn't the `bin/templates/scripts/cordova/lib/versions.js` file that I had to modify, it was the `platforms/ios/cordova/lib/versions.js` file, but I assume this is generated from the template file at installation time or some other time when stetted up. Also in the throws it would be nice if there was a message saying which plugin's version did not pass, otherwise it's a non-informative throws. Thanks again and keep up the good work  =||= Hi. I'm faced with same error few days ago. But I have no `beta` or smth else in versions.
Also, this error occurs when I'm trying to run/build project with connected device (iOS 13.1.3, 12.4.3, 12.4.2)

169Let Jasmine handle promises in testsRaphael von der Gr√ºnraphinesse11/21/19, 11:46:03 AM"Almost all asynchronous interfaces we provide or work with, make use of Promises. Jasmine has elegant [built-in support for handling promises](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/async#promises). Nonetheless, most asynchronous legacy tests don't make use of it. Instead, they are using makeshift and often buggy constructs using Jasmine's callback-style asynchronous tests (using the `done` parameter).

In many repos the transition to a simpler more robust Promise handling in tests has already been made. This issue should serve as a checklist of the remaining work in this area.

It's also often helpful to make this transition before removing Q (#7) in the given repo.

Of course, there are perfectly acceptable usages of `done`, most notably when working with callback-based async interfaces. But these are the vast minority in our tests.

174Install remote Cordova plugin that contains Java sub packages failsSaninn Salas Diazdistante11/17/19, 10:15:24 AM"# Bug Report

## Problem
When trying to install cordova plugins with sub packages the installation fails

### What is expected to happen?
Plugin should be installed

### What does actually happen?
Installation fails


## Information

I am working on my first cordova plugin and I am having problems when I try to install it from github.

My plugin has this folder structure:

    src
      android
        SubPackage
          SubClass1
          SubClass2
        OtherSubpackage
          OtherSubClass1
          OtherSubClass2
        JavaFile1.java
        JavaFile2.java

when I install it using `cordova plugin add ../path/to/local/folder/my-plugin` it works as expected. But when I try to install it using `git+https://github.com/distante/my-plugin` it throws an error with

> ...\SubPackage\SubClass1.java"" not found!

when I see inside the plugins folder I see that my `SubPackage` and `OtherSubPackage` folders does not exist. If I clone the github project it containts all the correct files.

My `plugin.xml` file contains all the `source-file` declarations and a global declaration of the feature name and after install it work as expected.

```
 <config-file target=""config.xml"" parent=""/*"">
            <feature name=""MyPlugin"">
                <param name=""android-package"" value=""com.disante.cordova.myplugin.MyPlugin""/>
            </feature>
        </config-file>
```

### Command or Code
cordova plugin add git@path-to-plugin



### Environment, Platform, Device
Windows 10



### Version information
* 9.0.0 (cordova-lib@9.0.1)
* ionic v5.4.2
* node v12.13.0

- [ x] I searched for already existing GitHub issues about this
- [ x] I updated all Cordova tooling to their most recent version
- [ x] I included all the necessary information above""To be clear, this isn't a domain, it is a reverse dns notation. It is used as a way to builld unique ids. In the case of android platforms, it is used to create packages, which hyphens are an illegal character. This is why we cannot accept an app id with hyphens. This is working as intended.

I suggest using a different name for app id, either omitting the hyphens, or replacing them with underscores. =||= - If you say ""reverse dns notation"" then we expect it to accept hyphens
- If you can't accept hyphens because of Android that's ok, but then we expect it to be documented (I could not find this behavior anywhere but maybe I missed it)

For anyone else coming here through a web search:
This repository pulls dependencies from other apache repositories, the validation for the id happens when this project calls [the cordova-cli routine for create](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/blob/838a05784a3bc040fbf1ec223fba976663954234/src/cli.js#L348) which in turn [runs the validation](https://github.com/apache/cordova-create/blob/5f24bdbceba46830a46dc940306688b2d71f447a/index.js#L68) from [valid-identifier](https://github.com/purplecabbage/valid-identifier)

So one way to fix this _situation_ is to improve valid-identifier to throw an Error or implement some mechanism to bubble the offending part, seeing how valid-identifier has not been updated in a few years Id say chances of pull requests being accepted are slim

In other words, maybe the best place for a bug report is the cordova-cli project, and not this one. =||= > So one way to fix this _situation_ is to improve valid-identifier to throw an Error or implement some mechanism to bubble the offending part, seeing how valid-identifier has not been updated in a few years Id say chances of pull requests being accepted are slim

Actually, the `valid-identifier` package is maintained by Cordova's current PMC chair, @purplecabbage. So if there would be a quality contribution to improve it, I'm sure it would be considered.

I don't think opening an issue in cordova-cli would help. I rather suggest you open a pull request on our docs to fix the lack of documentation regarding the constraints for app identifiers. =||= > If you say ""reverse dns notation"" then we expect it to accept hyphens

Yes, this is a ""gotcha"". Reverse DNS notation is what is commonly used in java/android land. But it's used for package and class names where the hyphen, and other special characters is illegal.

> If you can't accept hyphens because of Android that's ok, but then we expect it to be documented

I always feel the documentation can be improved and this could be one of those things, especially since Cordova tries to abstract native details away from its users... I raised an issue for this at https://github.com/apache/cordova-docs/issues/1087 =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

## Description
I'm bulding an application that supports dynamic links, and I'm using this plugin to help me achieve that (https://github.com/OutSystemsExperts/outsystems-cordova-plugin-firebase-with-dynamiclinks).
However I need some help to make a hook that selects the right files and places them in the right place when building the application. I've done a bit searching and found that a hook can help achieve that however I've never built one and I'm since the plugin has 2 dependencies I've no idea whats the order the scripts run and make both plugins still work fine.
## Information
<!-- Include all relevant information that might help understand and reproduce the problem -->
Basically the plugin needs 2 files, one for android and one for iOS. They need to be in 1 zip file called google-services.zip in a specific folder.
My goal is to have 3 zip files (for each environment), and when the application is being built, it takes the app identifier (com.comp.appdev or com.comp.appqms) and take the zip with that name (com.comp.appdev.zip) and converts it into google-services.zip to the right place.

## Description
I have developed an .net core 2.2 with an Angular 8 application. They both exist in the same project structure. The .net core application acts as an API for the client side Angular 8 application. When I am publishing app it will give me following folder structure:

Root Folder (having .net core files)
Root Folder/wwwroot
Root Folder/ClientApp/dist (having angular files)

This whole publish folder I am putting into ""www"" folder where cordova project resides. I changed the ""config.xml"" of cordova project.

`<content src=""ClientApp/dist/index.html"" />`

When i try to run the app on android, it just showing me ""Loading..."" message on emulator.

I understand that normal behavior of .net core application first bootstrap to project dll and then route to angular application. Then how to convert app to android in Cordova?

Thanks

A major, unfortunate limitation of Cordova is that your app has to wait for a ""deviceready"" event before attempting to use a Cordova plugin. This is known to trip up many, many apps using Angular and Ionic. I hope we can remove this requirement in an upcoming release. There is also Ionic Capacitor which is newer and does not suffer from this limitation.

import * as XLSX from 'xlsx';
constructor(private exportAsService: ExportAsService) {}

public exportExcel(jsonData: any[], fileName: string): void {
    const ws: XLSX.WorkSheet = XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet(jsonData);
    const wb: XLSX.WorkBook = { Sheets: { 'data': ws }, SheetNames: ['data'] };
    const excelBuffer: any = XLSX.write(wb, { bookType: 'xlsx', type: 'array' });
    var out = XLSX.write(wb, { type: 'base64' });
    var xlsContent = 'data:application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet;base64,' + out;

I am unable to do the same with the current version of Cordova with the files in the root /www/

Is this a bug?

in 2015 you could use some server code in order to do so :
```
require('http').createServer(function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, { 'content-encoding': 'gzip', 'content-type': 'application/gzip' });
  require('fs').createReadStream('platforms/platforms.json').pipe(require('zlib').createGzip()).pipe(response);
}).listen(1337);
```
This is not working anymore.

Can this be added/supported? Similar to what we have on Apache?
Or is there a new workaround?

If this is not making any sense to you check the below:
https://www.apphp.com/tutorials/index.php?page=gzip-and-deflate-compression-in-web-development""Can you tell me the point of this?

compressing files are generally only beneficial when you're sending that file through the network. The files inside your cordova `www` folder are being loaded directly from the filesystem, so no network is involved here. If anything, I think  this will result of longer loader times because it needs to compress and then decompress before the browser can start parsing. =||= Hi @breautek,
we then get some faster downloads of the final app from the stores.
App size is reduced overall using Gzip/Deflate.
While added loading times are marginal so it's a win-win.
Files are compressed and packaged in the app beforehand, so no need to compress them on the fly,
only the decompression is required.
We should have the option to do it like in previous versions.
Small size files are necessary for mobile Apps. =||= I see. This would require significant changes on the native side of each platform. The browser gzip functionality is part of their network stack, so it is not used when files are being loaded from the filesystem, which means each native implementation would have to include a gzip implementation and override resource loading (if that is even possible)

 I don't consider this a win-win, especially for the level of maintenance (high-risk to be app-breaking if something goes wrong) that would be required in the future.

> We should have the option to do it like in previous versions.

Cordova has never had a feature that compresses the `www` directory or any file inside that directory. It simply copies the files to the native app project that it manages for you. 

Cordova can use a remote URL as it's content loading point, and the webserver can use gzip so perhaps this is what you were thinking about, but this is **NOT** the recommended approach for final deployments, as it can be a reason for app rejection from the app stores.

Don't forget that, at least on android, APKs are already compressed (they are simply zip files afterall). I think it's safe to assume that the iOS IPA files are also compressed, though I don't know for sure.

If you want this kind of functionality, it would be better suited as a cordova plugin.

For the reasons above, I'll be closing this ticket. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

Are you able to provide a sample reproduction app that contains exactly what is needed to reproduce the issue and nothing more? (pure cordova, no frameworks like ionic, angular, etc).

The reason why Brody says we cannot support issues with Ionic is because frameworks can change the behaviour so it can be really hard to identify or reproduce issues, and by having frameworks or libraries, it opens up the possibility for the cause drastically. https://github.com/apache/cordova-contribute/blob/master/create-reproduction.md

Alternatively, if you provide us with a full error message, we may be able to provide some more insight. `XHR Poll Error` is a generic error message from the socket library you are using. I don't know too much about socket.io, but I suspect there are probably other relevant information that we are missing here. (Perhaps check the network tab?)

> everything works on api level 27 but on 28+ it does not

This is just a guess, but one notable change between API 27 and API 28 is that network traffic by default **must** be secure (therefore they need to use `https` protocol and your server needs to have a valid SSL certificate). =||= > Are you able to provide a sample reproduction app that contains exactly what is needed to reproduce the issue and nothing more? (pure cordova, no frameworks like ionic, angular, etc).

You can reproduce it just by creating an app adding socket io client and running the app in release mode.

Well @breautek the thing is that it works with api 28+ just in debug mode but in release mode it does not connect... I cannot debug it, check the network tab or anything releated to that.

204V8 Heap Snapshot for android - protects the javascript codeonelsonic03/07/20, 02:17:18 AM"Hi there,
please correct me if I am wrong.

On android Cordova is using the V8 JavaScript Engine?
So theoretically we should be able to enable the use of V8 Heap Snapshot in Cordova for Android?
With this we should be able to protect the Javascript Source code of the App created, and also speed up the execution of the Javascript Code, thus improving the performances of Cordova on Android.

I haven't found anything about this for Cordova.
V8 Snapshots : 
https://v8.dev/blog/custom-startup-snapshots

The same technique is use in Atom and NW.js.
https://flight-manual.atom.io/behind-atom/sections/how-atom-uses-chromium-snapshots/
https://nwjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/For%20Users/Advanced/Protect%20JavaScript%20Source%20Code/
""Cordova doesn't interface with V8 at all. It simply just interfaces with a webview (which happens to be chrome on android). And even then, we don't have direct access. Cordova only access to the java apis documented at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView

Not sure how it would be possible to get what you want (that would be a research project in itself), but I think it would involve bundling native libraries, and having a plugin that exposes native c methods to java (via jni) and having a Cordova plugin that handles the javascript to java api calls.

I'm closing the issue because this is not something Cordova will support. It is more appropriate as a third party plugin. We do welcome further discussion on our [slack](http://slack.cordova.io/) =||= ok thanks for your feedback, I will digg this around. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

we recently moved to ios 6.0.0, one of the changes switch from legacy launch images to story board images.
we created the images according to the dimensions given in the documentation
[launch storyboard images at cordova website](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/index.html#launch-storyboard-images)

and added the following to config.xml

```
<splash src=""res/screen/ios/Default@2x~iphone~anyany.png"" />
    <splash src=""res/screen/ios/Default@2x~iphone~comany.png"" />
    <splash src=""res/screen/ios/Default@2x~iphone~comcom.png"" />
    <splash src=""res/screen/ios/Default@3x~iphone~anyany.png"" />

    <splash src=""res/screen/ios/Default@2x~ipad~anyany.png"" />
    <splash src=""res/screen/ios/Default@2x~ipad~comany.png"" />
```

then ran the following command

`cordova prepare ios`

opened xcode, and navigated to Images.xcassets then LaunchStoryboard and saw the images.

then on the iphone x running ios 13.5.1 deleted the app to prevent cashing as mentioned.
run the app, but all i got is a white screen and then the app continue normally. 

i thought the problem was with photos, so i created one blue photo with dimensions 2732x2732
added `<splash src=""res/screen/ios/Default@2x~universal~anyany.png"" />` to config.xml and removed the others.

then ran

`cordova prepare ios`

opened xcode, and navigated to Images.xcassets then LaunchStoryboard and saw the blue image and the others removed.

but the same thing happened again, just white screen not my image.

i deleted the app every time i needed to install.
cleaned the build folder.
tried on the simulator with no use.

can anyone tell me what i am doing wrong ?

### Environment, Platform, Device
This issue is happening on Azure pipelines and even if I use cordova android version 8.1.0 the issue is same build fails on cordova build android script or cordova prepare android script. The same pipeline used to work with cordova 6 version previously but from june first week it started failing, so tried updating all plugin versions and cordova version to latest and local build work perfectly fine I am able to get debug apk. But to deploy changes release apk is failing at those shown scripts

225Can't access to FILE_URI of camera.getPicture Cordova IOS 6 and wkwebviewfattanasio07/07/20, 11:22:46 AM"I created a new standard with ios 6 to avoid rejecting the app from Apple.
In the config.xml I entered:
<preference name = ""scheme"" value = ""app"" />
<preference name = ""hostname"" value = ""localhost"" />
to be able to navigate in my application.
When I call the camera plugin:

`navigator.camera.getPicture(function(fileURI) {
		previewFoto(fileURI, id);
	}, function(error) {
		captureFotoError(error, id);
	},
	{
	quality: 20, 
	sourceType: navigator.camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY,
	mediaType: navigator.camera.MediaType.PICTURE,
	destinationType: navigator.camera.DestinationType.FILE_URI 
	}
);

function previewFoto(fileURI,id){
    var thumbnailPhoto = document.getElementById('thumbnailPhoto_'+id);
    $(""#thumbnailPhoto_""+id).addClass(""thumbnail"");
    thumbnailPhoto.src=fileURI;
}
`
I can't see the preview. Before installing cordova ios 6 and therefore also wkwebview the application worked correctly. 
Now I think there is a problem of link to the uri file of type file: //etc..../tmp/filename.jpg
I have searched all the forums but I cannot understand how to point to a camera file directly in my app.
I have cordova ios 6.1.0 and latest cordova-plugin-camera

## The Problem

The reason why this is failing is because two things are overriding the `addEventListener` API.

`zone-evergreen.js` does so at using this function: https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/b11bd466c20dc338b6d4d5bc3e59868ff263778d/dist/zone-evergreen.js#L1806

`zone-evergreen.js` is kind of complicated, so I'm not sure at what point it actually overrides the `addEventListener` function, I just know that it does. AB testing both versions in your reproduction app shows the event leads to `platform-browser.js:395` (angular framework code) 

```javascript
addEventListener(element, eventName, handler) {
    const plugin = this._findPluginFor(eventName);
    return plugin.addEventListener(element, eventName, handler);
}
````

Where on non-cordova, `plugin.addEventListener` method points to the function defined to `zone-evergreen.js` posted above,

and on Cordova, the function points to https://github.com/apache/cordova-browser/blob/3b077ad590adc6f53a93b8af98efb20f8b1caeb7/cordova-lib/cordova.js#L123

```javascript
document.addEventListener = function (evt, handler, capture) {
    var e = evt.toLowerCase();
    if (typeof documentEventHandlers[e] !== 'undefined') {
        documentEventHandlers[e].subscribe(handler);
    } else {
        m_document_addEventListener.call(document, evt, handler, capture);
    }
};
```
As you can see, Cordova overrides the addEventListener method to handle some cordova-specific events, such as `deviceready`, `pause`, `resume`, and `activated`. Cordova **will** fallback to the original implementation of `addEventListener` if the incoming event isn't a cordova-defined event. However, unfortunately that original implementation is a reference to the native `addEventListener` and not Angular's/Zone replacement implementation.

Basically this means angular never receives events such as `mousemove`.

Personally I see this as bad practice on both sides, no one should be touching/replacing native functions. This case is a prime example of the why. But obviously these are decisions well baked into both frameworks and is incredibly hard to change without virtually breaking every single project using the framework. This means Angular and Cordova doesn't really support each other (in a nice way, see the workaround).

## Workaround

I tried moving the `cordova.js` script tag so it's loaded after the angular framework. I also had to remove the `defer` attribute on the angular script tags to ensure that are loaded and executed first. This will make Cordova store a reference to the modified `addEventListener` interface rather than the browser's native function. This appears to work but mileage may vary. I'm not sure if this will break anything else, but I don't see deviceready not invoked 5 second warning, so *that's a good sign*.

Because I don't believe Cordova will change anything in relation to this, I'll be closing this issue. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

## Description
When trying to build debug release for android 9.0.0 it fails with a minSdkVersion message set to 21 where 22 minimum is expected although I tried almost all possible way to set it to 22 or above (Gradle.properties, Androidmanifest.xml, config xml, etc...)

## Checklist
<!-- Please check the boxes by putting an `x` in the `[ ]` like so: `[x]` -->

- [x] I searched for already existing GitHub issues about this
- [x] I updated all Cordova tooling to their most recent version
- [x] I included all the necessary information above""Cordova does not support API 21 (Android 5.0), so cordova-android@9 is min is set to 22, including at the framework level. This is why you're seeing a min SDK conflict, it's letting you know that another library that you are using has a higher min sdk, so that library may not work properly on anything lower.

If you must support API 21, you can do so by using the `<edit-config>` tag to add what is mentioned in the error. However a little disclaimer... This puts your configuration into an unsupported state. It may work, but it may break in the future without warning and only when the app reaches attempts to execute the problematic code resulting in a hard crash. It will be up to you to test your app thoroughly on API 21.

An untested example should look something like:

```
<!-- The manifest doesn't have the tools namespace by default, so we'll need this to use tools:overrideLibrary
<edit-config file=""AndroidManifest.xml"" target=""/manifest[@xmlns:tools]"" mode=""merge"">
    <manifest xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools"" />
</edit-config>

<!-- Override cordova -->
<edit-config file=""AndroidManifest.xml"" target=""/manifest/uses-sdk"" mode=""merge"">
    <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=""21"" tools:overrideLibrary=""org.apache.cordova"" />
</edit-config>
```

Docs for `<edit-config>` can be found at https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/plugin_ref/spec.html#edit-config

Unknow error, which has to do with cors issue. I tried to install Http Native and its also not working splash screen and hangs on the white screen.

How can l configure the CORS issue =||= If you're using XHR to load in local content (which is common with some frameworks like angular), then you must use cordova-ios@6 and schemes.

If for some reason you cannot upgrade to cordova-ios@6, then [cordova-plugin-wkwebview-file-xhr](https://github.com/oracle/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-file-xhr) will workaround the issue for local file requests (ie your `file://` xhr requests).

https://cordova.apache.org/howto/2020/07/18/uiwebview-warning.html

If you're trying to communicate with an external server, that server must implement a CORS policy to allow your app. The origin of your app will be `null` if you're using the `file://` protocol or whatever what your scheme setting is, e.g: `app://localhost`.

I do have a [blog post](https://breautek.com/2020/07/14/enabling-cors/) that goes into more detail on how to enable CORS on your server.

Because this isn't a bug or a feature request I'll be closing this ticket. A more suitable place for support is on our [slack](http://slack.cordova.io/).  =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

236Cordova CLI 10.0.0 uses default Cordova icons instead of the ones specified in config.xmlleandronorcio08/19/20, 09:26:03 AM"# Bug Report

## Problem
I just upgraded to Cordova CLI 10.0.0, and when I try to `cordova build android`, it unexpectedly generates the default cordova image assets and copies it to `platforms/android/app/src/main/res`.

### What is expected to happen?
I expect that the image assets that I specified will be used as the adaptive icons of my app. 


### What does actually happen?
What happens actually is that cordova uses its default icons instead of the ones that I have specified in my `config.xml` file.


## Information
<!-- Include all relevant information that might help understand and reproduce the problem -->
Everything was working fine when I was still using:
Cordova CLI 9.0.0
Cordova Android 8.1.0

But when I upgraded to:
Cordova CLI 10.0.0
Cordova Android 9.0.0

...I started experiencing the bug that I mentioned above.

Any help will be greatly appreciated, thank you. 



### Command or Code
<!-- What command or code is needed to reproduce the problem? -->
`cordova build android`


### Environment, Platform, Device

237Phonegap push plugin deprecationAdri Van HoudtAdriVanHoudt08/28/20, 02:37:51 PM"(Let me know if I'm in the wrong place to ask)

We used https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push but the latest version seems to fail on latest Cordova.
It also seems that the project is archived. I have no idea why/when, I can only assume due to PhoneGap going away.
I can also not directly ask them as the repo is archived.

Is there a plan from Apache/the Cordova project to adopt the plugin? I believe it is widely used.
In the meantime I've found https://github.com/havesource/cordova-plugin-push to be a good drop in replacement/fix.""Adobe has officially [ended support](https://blog.phonegap.com/update-for-customers-using-phonegap-and-phonegap-build-cc701c77502c) for PhoneGap and it will on longer be maintained, hence why the phonegap repos are being archived.

There hasn't really been any discussion of adopting the push plugin, or any of the other phonegap plugins at this time. (One has been started, but hasn't gain any traction). So currently https://github.com/havesource/cordova-plugin-push is the best replacement. Many of the Apache contributors are actually contributing to that project already.

> (Let me know if I'm in the wrong place to ask)

Usually we use [slack](http://slack.cordova.io/) for more support style questions.

Let me know if this answers your questions and I'll close this issue. =||= I figured they archived it due to the end of PhoneGap, but it isn't stated anywhere.
Usually people add a notice in the readme or something.

Slack is nice but doing it like this will hopefully allow others to find https://github.com/havesource/cordova-plugin-push as well. Since the original repo doesn't allow any issues it is nice to have somme public info out there.

 =||=  Adding `export CORDOVA_HOME=""~/.cordova""` will not help but add more errors. Because there is no folder in ~/ root directory. But it seems that might be the key
```

Yet, after playing with it a lot I found out that the actual problem is with util.js file under /usr/local/lib/node_modules/cordova/node_modules/cordova-lib/src/cordova/util.js and the problem was with the following line: global_config_path = path.join(HOME, '.cordova');

This code executes only in case CORDOVA_HOME environment variable does not exist. So I've just added it: export CORDOVA_HOME=""~/.cordova"" and the exception was gone. Hope it'll help someone.

These are all unsupported platforms. `cordova-android@9` is the latest version. This version also migrated away from using `shelljs` both for security, and better cross-platform support.

Also generally speaking, cordova project files should be owned as your logged in user, not `www-data`. If you have to change the ownership of your cordova project, then you should also make sure that you're using cordova commands under the correct user. =||= We were having similar issues, we uninstalled Node, purged user data of npm and npm-cache folders.

I personally wouldn't bother as the source code for the diagram is [saved in a gist](https://gist.github.com/raphinesse/a6f28acb2281b782d9fb5ef486834deb) and the image (sans sketchiness) can be recreated with regular `graphviz`. Plus, it would be one more place to update if the graph were to change. =||= > Looks good to me. Nice tool! Should we add the image file to repo in case the URL goes down?

Possible drawback of NOT adding the image to the repo: I can change it to anything I want by editing the code in my gist. :grin:  =||= Any way we could add the code, as a comment for example? =||= > > Looks good to me. Nice tool! Should we add the image file to repo in case the URL goes down?

> Possible drawback of NOT adding the image to the repo: I can change it to anything I want by editing the code in my gist.

Sorry, that's not true. The image references a specific version of the gist.


> Any way we could add the code, as a comment for example?

I thought about that, but the code would be duplicated between the comment and the gist, having a negative impact on maintainability. An alternative (non-sketchy) approach would be to use that glitch service that I used for prior graphs. Its links contain the graph code as an url parameter: https://graphviz2.glitch.me/?graph=digraph+%22Cordova+Dependencies%22+%7B%0Acli+-%3E+%7Blib%2C+create%2C+common%7D%3B%0Aplugman+-%3E+lib%3B%0Alib+-%3E+%7Bfetch%2C+serve%2C+common%7D%3B%0Alib+-%3E+platforms+%5Bstyle%3Ddotted%5D%3B%0Acreate+-%3E+%7Bfetch%2C+%22app-hello-world%22%2C+common%7D%3B%0Afetch+-%3E+common%3B%0A%0Aplatforms+%5Bshape%3Drecord+label%3D%22%7BPlatforms%7C%7B%3Call%3E*%7C%3Capple%3Eios%2C+osx%7C%3Cwww%3Ebrowser%7D%7D%22%5D%3B%0Aplatforms%3Aapple+-%3E+%22node-xcode%22%3B%0Aplatforms%3Awww+-%3E+serve%3B%0Aplatforms%3Aall+-%3E+common%3B%0Aplatforms%3Aall+-%3E+js+%5Bstyle%3Ddotted%5D%3B%0A%7D%0A =||= "Add dependency overview to README.mdRaphael von der Gr√ºnraphinesse09/22/20, 09:55:38 PM"### Motivation and Context

I am using IP address for access API, Is that allowed with this solution as you see in image  =||= Yes. If you're using the file:// protocol, then you must use the wildcard `*` to allow any origin.

If you're using scheme, then you're origin with be `<scheme>://<host>` ie.... the default scheme settings cordova use is `app://localhost`.

If more than one client uses the same APIs (such as a website), then you'll need to implement backend logic that checks the `Origin` header and if acceptable, then set the response `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header appropriately. =||= Hi, I am also running into this CORS issue, but my app downloads files from githubusercontent.com so I don't have control of the server. I tried the local fix by setting scheme and hostname in config.xml, but I'm still getting this ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"" error. Is there a workaround in this case?

252Package.json is updated incorectly when adding platform?Harel MHarelM11/10/20, 06:55:01 PM"# Bug Report
When I use a clean installation of my project and run `cordova platform add android` my `package.json` file gets changed significantly, and incorrectly.

### What is expected to happen?
`package.json` should be respected

### What does actually happen?
`package.json` get overwritten. Also dependencies are getting the wrong version


## Information
It might be because I have the packages registered in dependencies and not devDependencies, I don't know...


### Command or Code
Project can be found here:
https://github.com/IsraelHikingMap/Site/tree/master/IsraelHiking.Web



### Environment, Platform, Device
Currently testing on Android


### Version information
Cordova cli: 10.0
cordova-android: 9.0

This started happening after the upgrade to 10.0 and android 9.0.

## Checklist

- [x] I searched for existing GitHub issues
- [x] I updated all Cordova tooling to most recent version
- [x] I included all the necessary information above""Seems like when the cordova plugins are in the devDependencies it works as expected. I guess that it should be written somewhere in the release notes? =||= @jcesarmobile was this fixed in any way? There's a real problem in the definition of where things should be I order to be respected by cordova...
For example when setting the cordova-ios to be a git address it does not get respected when in dev dependencies, only in dependencies...
Took me quite a while to get everything working after the upgrade to cordova 10... =||= You have reported it on cordova-cli, which is the proper repo to report it, so closing this because it‚Äôs a duplicate and not the proper place =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

255synchronize files with the browser when testingAymen BoughanmiaymenBox11/10/20, 02:14:58 PM"# Feature Request

## Motivation Behind Feature
<!-- its very annoying to type every time you make changes cordova run browser it will be much easier if the files inside the www folder are synchronized with the browser. -->



## Feature Description
<!-- 
just like in other framework like angular or ionic if you make any modification to one of your files it will be automatically synchronized with the browser.
-->



## Alternatives or Workarounds
<!-- 
to solve this issue I create this python script https://github.com/aymenBox/cordova-sync-browser/tree/main
which detect any changes in any file inside the www folder than stop the current server and start another one fill free to use it any one

Issue started to occur yesterday during build automation in Azure Pipelines, I notices npm versions were different, as it still worked locally, but maybe this was cached, as I updated to the same version locally and it started failing, but when I reverted back, it has been failing ever since.

### Command or Code
Issue can be reproduced from new project
```
cordova create hello com.example.hello HelloWorld
cd hello
cordova platform add ios
```

### Environment, Platform, Device
Tested with multiple macOS

macOS - Big Sur 11.0.1 (local machine)
macOS - Catalina 10.15 (Azure Pipelines Agent)

### Version information
Cordova CLI: 10.0.0
npm: 6.14.8

macOS - Big Sur 11.0.1 (local machine)
macOS - Catalina 10.15 (Azure Pipelines Agent)

Nonetheless, NodeJS 15 will _probably_ still work fine as long as you downgrade NPM back to 6.x. You can do this by doing `npm install -g npm@6`.

265Is plugin removal broken when there are plugin dependencies?Michael Tamburromsmtamburro01/21/21, 01:27:26 PM"# Bug Report

Something seems to have changed in cordova 10 with respect to `cordova plugin remove` when there are dependencies.  This new behavior makes it difficult for plugin authors to easily remove and then re-add (linked) a plugin when we need to make changes.

## Problem

`cordova plugin remove --nosave xxx` used to remove a plugin, even if there were dependencies involved, but it now, even if you use `--force` it sometimes fails to get the job done, leaving some dependencies installed, as well as the main plugin itself.

It goes without saying that, if it hasn't removed, I cannot attempt to do `cordova plugin add --link --nosave xxx` as my next step.

### What is expected to happen?

It would be nice for `remove` followed by `add --link` to work even when there are dependencies, but I'd be happy enough if they just operated on the main plugin and ignored the dependencies.  

### What does actually happen?

Removal seems to partially fail (I haven't figured out if it is only when plugin dependencies have dependencies themselves, so I'll have to do more testing).

## Information
<!-- Include all relevant information that might help understand and reproduce the problem -->

For example:

npx cordova plugin remove --nosave @company/cordova-plugin-pushaaaa --force

Results in:

npx cordova plugin remove -d --nosave @company/cordova-plugin-pushaaaa --force

267"""TypeError: Failed to fetch"" - Only on using fetch method on Android"Ben TimorBenTimor01/25/21, 07:59:42 AM"# Support / Bug Report

## Problem

I have an express server which has an API endpoint of /todo/set which gets a JSON, POST request. This API uses cors.

The API's working, it's tested with Postman (On same computer and on another computer on same LAN) and it's working with fetch (JavaScript) when using a browser (both on phone and computer). Tried to check it both with only running Svelte server and using cordova browser platform.

The problem is, When using Cordova android application, the fetch is returning ""TypeError: Failed to fetch"" and the server is not getting the request.

This is the code for example:
```
fetch(`http://localhost:8080/todo/set`, {
    method: ""post"",
    body: JSON.stringify({
        'Text': 'Test!'
    }),
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    }
}).then(res => alert(res)).catch(err => alert(err))
```

* Tried to replace the ""localhost"" with my local IP. Same issue. 
* The code is the same for the phone application and the website, I'm just running it differently (`cordova run android` vs `cordova run browser`).

### What is expected to happen?
The server had to get the request at least.

### What does actually happen?
Throwing an error and the server is not getting any request.

## Information
Posted it also on StackOverflow, Maybe it's a little more clear there: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65864040/typeerror-failed-to-fetch-only-on-cordova-application

### Reproduce
- Create a local express server and try to fetch json data from it via Cordova android applicatoin. 

### Environment, Platform, Device
- Developing on Arch Linux.
- The application is for android phone, Samsung Note 9 specifically

### Version information
- Using Svelte for Frontend 3.0.0
- Cordova 10.0.0
- Cordova platform LS:
```
Installed platforms:
  android 9.0.0
  browser
```
I'm using a clone of this repository for the application development: https://github.com/BenTimor/SvelteCordova

You need to make sure the following:
- the server is bound to a reachable ip address. For simplicity, the server can listen on 0.0.0.0, which means use any available ip address.
- the server and the device should be connected to the same network. If you're on a home network, then your ip address will probably look like 192.168.x.y. `x` will be the same for your phone and the server, but `y` will be different.
- finally, in your app, you should be referencing the server ip address, not localhost or 127.0.0.1.

To determine the ip address on the server use `ipconfig` on windows, or `ifconfig` on linux/mac.

Sorry if the post wasn't clear, I know what you're talking about and I've already tried it all.

I've even installed an application named ""Restler"" which is very similar to Postman and it's working to send the request to the server (from my phone!), But my application doesn't send any request.

Even if I'm hosting the application as a static (only frontend) website and using it on my phone it keeps working. It's only not working as an APK (And ofcourse I'm not changing the code, Only compiling it with Cordova). =||= Ok, we will need to know the exact error message you are seeing to provide anymore insight. =||= > Ok, we will need to know the exact error message you are seeing to provide anymore insight.

To answer your question however...

Most Google APIs intended to be consumed by web applications are assumed to ran from a webserver and are often tied to a domain. This is a problem for Cordova apps as they are domain-less since the application is not hosted on a webserver, but the device itself.

Most Google APIs intended to be consumed by mobile applications often have tools to restrict API usage to the application/bundle id and this is the proper way to consume such libraries.

284Can We Work with Multiple JDK Version?codenfast04/18/21, 10:49:29 AM"# Feature Request

## Motivation Behind Feature
**JDK 8 is going too old**, can we upgrade it to JDK 11?
Currently there is no path giving to a specified JDK location. So cordova's mandatory JDK-8 is when i work with mobile change to system enviroment ...etc. We need a set JDK location by run cordova. 

## Feature Description
Normally we are run cordova with (example);
`cordova run android`
But cordova says;
`Requirements check failed for JDK 8 ('1.8.*')! Detected version: 11
Check your ANDROID_SDK_ROOT / JAVA_HOME / PATH environment variables.`
if we can run with a specified JDK location, like;
`cordova run android -jdk C:/oldJava/jdk8/bin`
We can use multiple JDK versions will be more useful for cli commands


## Alternatives or Workarounds
There is no alternative. I was searched (google, stackoverflow and documents).

""I think it's safe to say that everyone in the Cordova team would be happy if we could stop having to require JDK 8. We always have inherited this requirement from the Android tooling. While it seems that it might finally be possible to use a newer JDK with Android tooling, there's a lot to watch out for with your setup and there would still be changes to be made to cordova-android. We probably will get there eventually, but it is just not a top priority right now.

I do not think we want to introduce a command line option to set the JDK. There is a simple workaround: setting `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables. In POSIX shells (e.g. Git Bash) this could look like this:

```
export JAVA_HOME=C:/oldJava/jdk8
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

In Windows `cmd` (untested):
```
set JAVA_HOME=C:/oldJava/jdk8
set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%/bin;%PATH%
```

After that, all commands in this shell session will use the updated environment variables. So you can just use `cordova run android`. You can also change environment variables per command. The complexity of that varies depending on your shell.

On Unix-like operating system (macOS, Linux, ‚Ä¶) you can nicely automate this process using [direnv](https://direnv.net/). I just put above commands inside a `.envrc` file in the projects that use `cordova-android` and `direnv` applies the changes to the environment variables whenever I change into that directory.

Of course you can also write a little helper script named `usejdk8` that changes the environment. =||= Just wanted to note that current AS alpha preview uses java 11, so soon.... we will be able to upgrade to java 11. But i don't think it will happen in our next major cordova-android@10 =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

This isn't valid for JDK-8 and so causes an error when trying to build.""`cordova-android` does not add this to the `gradlew` file.

I assume it must be coming from a plugin, I would advise doing a search in your `plugins/` folder to see which plugin may be adding this.

I'll be closing this issue, but if you believe there is an actual bug with the android platform, I'd suggest opening a new issue in the [cordova-android](https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/issues) repository.

287After SSO login using InAppBrowser plugin, it doesnot persist cookies while returning to app so unable to reload ios app priyankabakkar05/19/21, 09:12:32 AM"# Bug Report

## Problem
We have hybrid app developed using cordova. Our app is ‚ÄúSwiftEnterprise‚Äù available on apple store.
We have functionality of SSO login which we are achieving using InAppBrowser plugin. Earlier it was working fine but from Aug 2020 it stopped working for ios.

We are able to login to SSO url, using InAppBrowser plugin but after login we were redirecting to our main app. Issue is, now we are not able to reload our app as jsession cookies are missing. Application not able to load. I guess it is cookies issue, I tried setting manual cookies as well but nothing works out.

### What is expected to happen?
After successful SSO login we redirect back to main application by closing inappbrowser. Here we expect to get jsession Id so that our session timeout will not happen and app can able to reload


### What does actually happen?
Currently on login we are getting session timeout because of missing cookies

### Environment, Platform, Device
<!-- In what environment, on what platform or on which device are you experiencing the issue? -->

I am using cordova-plugin-whitelist.""That isn't  a content security issue, its cors issue (two independent browser security features).

Cors is a backend server configuration thing. If you're hitting an external server, then you must configure the server to respond to the request with the appropriate headers. I have a [blog post](https://breautek.com/articles/enabling-cors.html) that goes into more detail.

If you're hitting a local endpoint, such as attempting to load an angular template for example, then you must either enable schemes[1] or use an xhr fix plugin[2].

[1] schemes were introduced as part of the UIwebview to wkwebview migration: https://cordova.apache.org/howto/2020/07/18/uiwebview-warning.html

## Solution

By https://stackoverflow.com/a/68430992



First of all, I face this issue in Android Studio 4.2.2 and you not need to downgrade the SDK build tool 31 to 30 or not to change compile SDK version.

The main problem is the two files missing in SDK build tool 31 that are

    dx.bat
    dx.jar

The solution is that these files are named d8 in the file location so changing their name to dx will solve the error.

The steps are below.

    go to the location

     ""C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\31.0.0""

    find a file named d8.bat. This is a Windows batch file.

    rename d8.bat to dx.bat.

    after changing d8.jar to dx.jar // now rename d8.jar to dx.jar

    It will be in location:

     ""C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\31.0.0\lib""

    Remember AppData is a hidden folder. Turn on hidden items to see the AppData folder.

Now run your project...
""Cordova doesn't support build tools 31, and cannot do so without implementing breaking changes.

It requires AGP 7 and Java 11 for it to work properly. 

I also would advise against changing build tools, dx is intentionally missing because Google is replacing it with a different tool.

Closing because this is already being tracked: https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/issues/1309

For cordova-android@10, I'd recommend sticking with build tools 30.0.3. =||= "NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN0

## Problem



### What does actually happen?

when i try to load image in canvas it will show this error
Access to image at 'http://localhost/_app_file_/storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.abc.xyz/1616587242F2.png' from origin 'https://localhost' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. in index.html.

I convert my url by this this.win.Ionic.WebView.convertFileSrc(imageUrl.toString()); but still i am facing this error. (it will convert file:// to http://localhost/_app_file_/...)

**if i used this URL in image tag then its worked but in canvas i am gating error.**
Note : i think this error occurs because cordova 10.0.1 remove whitelist plugin. (it will work in previous api 29)

   npm               : 6.14.8
   OS                : Windows 10""You're getting the error because you're mixing protocols. E.g. your app is configured to use the scheme `https` but you're attempting to load a `http` url (instead of `https)`, thus you're making a cross origin request.

Try converting the url from http url to https.

Alternatively you can read the `file://` url using the `cordova-plugin-file` plugin to get the `Blob` type and create an [object url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL).

I'm closing this issue because CORS is a browser security feature with no API for us to disable it, so our only option work around it. The above should suffice. If you require any more assistance, I'll invite you to join our [Slack community](http://slack.cordova.io/).
